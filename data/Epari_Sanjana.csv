"Biryani & Co","False","True","5","My mom’s biryani is def ranked #1, but the biryani here is top tier!! I have ordered takeout 3 times already. It’s flavorful and you can see the typical spices (cinnamon stick, cardamom, etc) in the dish. You can even modify the spice level. I feel it’s leaning more on the authentic side, where the restaurant is not just mixing chicken with rice. My go to is the chicken dum biryani and my dad loved the chicken lollipop.

"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","False","True","4","There were plenty of options for coffee and quick bites, both savory and sweet. I wasn’t too particular on the drinks, but heard it’s not the best place if you like your coffee strong. Would visit again for the ambiance, as it was right by the waters! They normally have live music on the weekends, and if you reserve etickets online (it’s free), you can get 20% off your orders :) also a great place to bring your pups as they have outdoor seating!

"The Historic Victory Grill","False","True","5","My friends and I were planning on going to another restaurant, but with the long wait decided to eat at this place. We thought it was just gonna have diner kind of food, but this restaurant exceeded our expectation in all sorts of ways. 

You will get a typical southern comfort soul food experience here. The fried chicken and waffles were some of the best I have ever had. It truly touched my soul. The waffles were soft and slightly crunchy, like well balanced textures. There was not one red flag in this meal so will be coming back here again :) My friends and I also ordered a bunch of sides with huge portions. Mac and cheese was a must have. 

It was pretty quiet place when we went around 8pm. Our waitress was very sweet. They apparently host events like poetry nights, rap battles and other kind of shows. So I definitely want to come back when they are hosting something.
