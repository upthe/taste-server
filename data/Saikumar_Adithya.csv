"Massaya Lebanese Restaurant & Bar","False","True","4","I’ve been looking for a good shawarma spot in Ashburn for so long and here comes Massaya.  This is a brand new Lebanese restaurant in the Goose Creek shopping center and I’ll likely be a regular.  For my first meal I got a chicken shawarma platter to go with a side of fries and hummus.  I enjoyed the flavor and the decent quantity and it’s notable that overall the dish was light on salt which made me feel healthy lol.  I’ll be making my way through the menu and also the staff are super nice and sociable","2022-05-18 14:42:24.649506+00:00"
