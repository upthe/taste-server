"Buddakan","False","True","5","*caveat that I did not pay for this dinner

Really impressive and swanky space in a cool neighborhood, rated $$$$ and probably best for a special occasion. People described this place to me as Asian fusion but I’d actually say a lot of dishes were mostly traditional Chinese, sometimes with an elevated twist. They have some novelty dishes that are super worth trying (cauliflower lollipops and edamame dumplings, both with purées of the namesake vegetables), as well as some classics (Peking duck, beef chow fun, ma po tofu) but pretty much everything is good! Also has a very strong bar program with a lot of proprietary cocktails - would recommend The Restraint and The Answer.","2022-09-06 23:01:18.848411+00:00"
"Ichiran","False","True","4","Another big tourist draw, but this place is legit and worth the wait to get in. Be warned: the FOH does a very good job manipulating people in line to stay put with optimistic wait time announcements. If you aren’t familiar, Ichiran only does one thing: tonkotsu ramen, with a few customizations allowed via a “choose your own adventure” ordering sheet. They strive to do it very well and with a minimum of distractions, hence the divided dining booths and wordless ordering & service. If there was a Platonic ideal of what a tonkotsu ramen dinner should be, this would probably be it. But I walked away wishing that the noodles and the cuts of pork were a little bit thicker - that’s a minor difference in personal preference though and overall I still think Ichiran is extremely good ramen!","2022-09-06 23:11:45.157978+00:00"
"Ume Williamsburg","False","True","4","Very interesting concept (be prepared for a very particular set of rules and instructions for dining), thoughtfully prepared and well-presented dishes, peaceful and calm vibes. Even though it’s a prix fixe menu, you still have a fair bit of choice in how you assemble your food into hand rolls, and they have a la carte items too. The summer yuzu sake was memorable. Food was excellent, but definitely pretty pricey.","2022-08-29 03:16:36.215384+00:00"
"Katz's Delicatessen","False","True","5","I mean are you kidding this place is the *real deal*, definitely a tourist trap (although I saw a fair number of apparent regulars) and the line was still deep at 9PM on a Monday, but the food was sooo worth the wait. I ended up going with the classic Pastrami on Rye and let me tell you: I think died that night and went to deli heaven. The fries were substantial, the pickles were bright and crunchy, and I’m not sure if I will ever have a better (or meatier) pastrami sandwich in my life. Absolute must try!!","2022-09-06 22:49:55.509441+00:00"
"Pasquale Jones","False","True","4","Caught the very tail end of their weeknight service as a solo diner - very cool ambiance (would definitely recommend getting a seat at the bar so you can spy on the line cooks at work) and a creative, sophisticated menu. Not that many options and somewhat pricey for what you get, but the food is super tasty and well-made!","2022-09-06 22:53:22.111113+00:00"
"Mymy","False","True","4","Super tasty food, well-sized portions. Wait time was a bit long and outdoor seating was noisy and not super comfortable","2022-08-08 02:38:35.374480+00:00"
"Lakou Cafe","False","True","5","Very small (~20 seats indoors, ~15 outdoors) but amazing vibes and colorful decor. Ample portions served in thoughtfully-packaged tin boxes. Kreyol shrimp & rice plate was an incredible flavor bomb!! There’s also a full crepes / baked goods / coffee / drinks menu that I didn’t try, but would come back for.","2022-08-29 03:12:28.247056+00:00"
