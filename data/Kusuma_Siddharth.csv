"Esters Wine Shop & Bar","False","True","5","Very scrumptious dishes, everything was amazing. Quite the selection of vegetarian options and the cocktails are something to write home about. ","2022-06-19 21:21:38.545270+00:00"
"Abhiruchi Grill","False","True","5","A Hyderabadi biryani lover will not be disappointed. Amazing biryani and other authentic Telugu foods. Service is fast and try the Gobi Manchurian as well!","2022-06-19 21:18:23.722186+00:00"
"Killer Noodle","False","True","5","Literally best restaurant ever. Get the Tokyo Style, without soup (veggie broth for me ðŸ˜‹) and you can customize the spice scale and numbness scale! Sooo good","2022-06-19 21:16:11.631860+00:00"
"Annapurna Cuisine","False","True","5","Best restaurant for traditional South Indian fare that youâ€™ll find in LA outside of Artesia. Pongal is my favorite, but the dosa and vada are great too. Gobi Manchurian and chai are very yummy. You will not be disappointed.","2022-06-19 21:25:57.324031+00:00"
"Killer Noodle","False","True","5","If you love noodles, this place is killer. 12/10 would recommend, you will typically have to wait a little bit for your table, but trust me itâ€™s worth it. Sichuan pepper flavor does not miss. Check it out! ","2022-06-19 21:24:14.273318+00:00"
