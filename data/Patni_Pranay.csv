"Tacoria","False","True","5","The golden avocado mission style burrito is soooo good!! Nothing compared to burritos in SF imo still but honestly best burrito I’ve found in NY/NJ — the vegan chipotle aioli hits and the Habanero sauce is also really spicy and yummy ","2022-06-21 03:39:17.609524+00:00"
"The Kati Roll Company","False","True","3","Overhyped! The paneer roll is okay but I don’t like the way they prepare the vegetables with the paneer — not trynna bite into a whole cherry tomato

I’d say thelewala on McDougall is 10 times better ","2022-04-28 04:43:43.079331+00:00"
"Deep Indian Kitchen - Flatiron","False","True","3","Pretty solid kathi roll! Was a bit spicy! I’d say better then kathi roll company but not as good as Thelewala","2022-05-31 02:59:33.930259+00:00"
"BCD Tofu House","False","True","4","They have a few veg options the bibimbap and tofu soup are both really really yummy! Def a better place for people who eat fish but still would come back ","2022-05-14 14:09:32.863913+00:00"
"Han Dynasty","False","True","4","Got recommended this as a better version of Spicy Moon! From a vegetarian standpoint, they do have a lot of options and a pretty similar menu, but I do think spicy moon is significantly better.

Bonus star for the fact that they are open pretty late though","2022-07-11 17:46:36.176699+00:00"
"Malai","False","True","5","Lovee all the flavors — I’d say the ice cream runs sweeter than most places so if you don’t have a sweet tooth be warned

"Quesada Burritos & Tacos","False","True","3","Basically another chipotle knockoff 

Bowl was okay, too much lettuce and they guac is not great..

The big thing they have going for them is that they have so many different sauces that were all really good!! The vegan chipotle aioli and the ghost pepper sauce were both fantastic would bottle those up and buy them individually for sure ","2022-04-30 02:06:47.855101+00:00"

"Red Bamboo","False","True","4","Another vegan spot worth checking out in NYC! I’m a pretty big fan of their bbq buffalo wings and the creole soul chicken!

Love that they give a bunch of other sauces on the side as well as unlimited pita bread as well.

"Casa Kaizen","False","True","5","Fully vegan, Asian Mexican fusion!!!

The taco combination platter was amazing, my favorite one was the mango one.

The nachos were the star of the show!!! Pan fried gyoza as a nachos topping with guac and queso and sour cream worked so so surprisingly well. Would go back for those nachos","2022-04-30 02:10:42.392699+00:00"

"Milan Sweet Center","False","True","5","This has been my all time favorite restaurant ever since I was in elementary school!

"Thaism","False","True","3","Honestly was pretty not vegetarian friendly compared to other Thai restaurants I’ve visited. Got the basil fried rice and the panang curry, both were average imo.

"Benares","False","True","5","Their lunch prefix menu is an incredible deal and the food is actually so good! For vegetarians, 1 main dish + an app, naan, rice, and curry all for 15 bucks and the portions were honestly big enough for two meals for me","2022-07-23 23:25:19.981829+00:00"

"Kajitsu","False","True","4","Okay so had been super hyped to go to this place for a really long time.. vegan omakase like what

Pros: the food was very very simple and fresh and just felt healthy! All the courses were unique and the explanation that went with each dish made the experience. Had a really really great time (spent 3 hours there)

Cons: taste wise I felt like I wanted more! Maybe I was expecting something rich and decadent but in reality it was a really simple (but still elegant) meal.

Wish it was cheaper don’t know if I could justify paying that much for this experience again (unless I’m with amazing company!)","2022-04-28 04:12:05.439014+00:00"

"Xi'an Famous Foods","False","True","2","Okay this had been hyped up a lottttt for me but when I went I wasn’t sure what the best vegetarian option was so I got the Liang Pi Cold Skin noodles (A1) 

Honestly the noodles themselves were fantastic but it was a cold dish and the sauce was a bit too sour for my liking

If someone can Rec a better vegetarian dish here would try again but otherwise I don’t see the hype for vegetarians","2022-06-21 03:42:04.949617+00:00"

"Fons - Plant Based Café","False","True","3","Decent spot for vegan empanadas, have had better though!

Favorite empanada was probably the corn one or the apple cinnamon! Biggest complaint was that the empanadas had a lot more crust than filling and the crust was incredibly dry.

The garlic dipping sauce is super yummy though","2022-07-29 19:00:22.332346+00:00"
