"Burrito Brothers","False","True","4","YUM. Fast, fresh, relatively cheap and delicious. Salsa verde wasn‚Äôt my fav but is free! Also not enough pico (or maybe they forgot lol) on my burrito. But would def return if ever I return to the restaurant abyss that is The Area Surrounding The Capitol. Did I spell that right? Also saw the VP‚Äôs motorcade go by so hey Kamala

"Ellƒì","False","True","5","This place is BOMBBBB. Excellent pastries and other food, smooth and tasty espresso, warm ambiance, nice servers. Everything tastes so fresh and has lovely unexpected flavor combos, eg rosemary in the cranberry-orange scone or a hint of cinnamon in the mocha. It‚Äôs def pricey but worth it as a special treat. Warning, it is BUSY on weekends especially with the farmer‚Äôs market on Saturdays but bonus points for Mount Pleasant being a cute lil neighborhood ","2023-01-03 17:00:08.452036+00:00"
"The Waverly Inn And Garden","False","True","4","Very fancy and ~exclusive~ place where APPARENTLY the stars eat. I could swear I saw Stanley Tucci outside but it was probably just some random guy with his family (his own, not Stanley Tucci‚Äôs.) Anyway my $40 miso grilled chicken was tasty but a touch too salty and the vibes were off as a solo diner, the tables are wayyyy too close together so I‚Äôd recommend sitting outside instead (I was out there then asked to be moved inside, the v friendly staff obliged). No photos bc the menu said it was forbidden üôÑüôÑ","2022-09-04 14:50:18.416074+00:00"
"D Light Cafe & Bakery","False","True","5","I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place. It truly might be the best cafe in DC. The food is SO good, always freshly prepared and different than what you can find almost anywhere else (cottage cheese pancakes with matcha custard?! out of this world). The fruit flavored lattes are a must (pink dreams aka raspberry, or blueberry candy) and to top it off the owners are sisters from Ukraine and just the nicest people ever. I LOVE IT","2022-09-21 16:17:48.220587+00:00"
"Absolute Bagels","False","True","5","Classic NY bagels worth waiting in line for! The staff is friendly and efficient. I got the egg bagel with herb cream cheese and it was perfectly sweet/salty/chewy. I forgot to take a pic bc I ate it so fast lol","2022-09-04 14:39:35.886523+00:00"
"Emissary","False","True","4","More like a 3.5. I have mixed feelings on Emissary- the vibes are great, very hip and cozy (warning: it‚Äôs dark), and the lattes are decent- a little bitter for my taste but my taste is also ‚Äúchocolate milk.‚Äù Mochas come with a lil piece of chocolate so thats a bonus. Food is yummy but expensive and there aren‚Äôt many options. Overall, come for the vibes and bc PETE DAVIDSON went here one time ","2022-10-26 19:01:18.882523+00:00"
"Brew Birds","False","True","5","Delicious espresso drinks and seriously good food! Lots of outdoor seating.","2022-08-14 18:14:54.455818+00:00"
