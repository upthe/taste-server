"Shlock’s","False","True","4","Very good but very expensive. Heard their lox is good but didn’t try. Make sure to order online early in the morning instead of waiting in their long line","2022-04-18 02:06:27.495895+00:00"
"Nōvy","False","True","4","Pasta honestly wasn’t that great. Had a lot of feta which didn’t pair well with the rest of the pasta. Appetizers were good, vibe was nice/fun, we were able to walk up and get a table on a Saturday at 8","2022-03-22 18:21:06.576403+00:00"
"Penny Roma","False","True","5","Amazing pastas, so good we went twice in two weeks. May be the best pasta I’ve ever had. Portions were just right. Beautiful interior. From the flour and water crew","2022-04-16 18:16:36.801939+00:00"
