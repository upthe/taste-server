"Snooze, an A.M. Eatery","False","True","3","Maybe this is a hot take but I thought this place was super average, we got breakfast tacos and the crab cake. Also they have their dishwasher room right next to their outdoor seating and it smelled so bad 🤢 ","2022-08-28 16:52:58.034683+00:00"
"Adalina","False","True","5","This Italian spot is super nice so def dress accordingly - e.g. waiters are in suits. Amazing wine selection + pastas + lamb chops + tiramisu. Next time I’ll make sure not to show up in a flannel and leggings ","2022-06-01 03:51:47.155619+00:00"

Recommend getting the Daily Spread which is $35pp and includes 12 ~unlimited~ mezze spreads for the table, all veg, with a giant laffa bread for dipping! The non-veg skewers were just ok, which is why this didn’t get full 5 stars, but go for the veg mezze it’s yummy!! 🤌🏽🥖🫒","2022-04-28 13:56:48.131943+00:00"
