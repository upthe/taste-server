"ilcaffè","False","True","5","PERFECT place for an early morning coffee - I am not a coffee drinker so I ordered the chai latte and split an apple danish with my friend. I'm usually very picky about chai lattes, but this was a top tier latte. would definitely get it again if i lived in the downtown area.

the danish was so fresh and warm, literally melted in my mouth. it was the best start to the day and service was 10/10","2022-05-11 15:58:41.086518+00:00"

"Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe","False","True","5","If you haven't been to wildberry for brunch, it is a Chicago MUST. I usually go there for touristy visits, my sister was visiting and we were craving some good hearty food. The wait time can be long, depending on when you go. We got there at 11 am on a Saturday and had to wait outside for 30 minutes but was so worth!

Once we got inside, we ordered hot chocolate which came instantly and was SO tasty. Also only $4 for a huge mug - steal 😍

my sister and I split the Mexicana skillet and the
chocolate chip and banana pancakes. The food
came out so quickly and everything tasted so fresh. We had so much food and ended up taking most of the pancakes home LOL

Overall, a solid meal, good mix of savory and sweet! 10/10 would recommend, I've gone to wildberry many times and it's always worth.","2022-05-10 02:25:40.390475+00:00"

"Olio e Piú","False","True","5","absolutely loved the vibe of Olio e Piú 🥲 I came here with a couple friends for brunch. I split the carbonara and ravioli with my friend and paired it with some rose and red wine.

I've never had carbonara before, but I loved the concept of having an egg on the top and I felt like it complimented the pasta quite nicely. I'm usually not a fan of pork, but the pork tasted amazing as well!

The burrara and Lemoncello ravioli was very unique in its flavoring but still 👌🏽

we all split tiramisu for dessert and that was absolutely amazing. you MUST get it!","2022-05-06 20:09:53.704566+00:00"

"Medium Rare - Arlington","False","True","4","came here for my moms birthday, place has a nice ~aesthetic~ with the lights along the window! we got seated immediately since we had a reservation.

they had a prix fixe menu with bread, salad and steak. I really enjoyed the salad and the steak (the sauce was really good) but the bread was eh in my opinion. my mom and sister got sangria and it tasted good but nothing too special. they gave 2 servings of steak and fries so a lot to take home!

we told the waiter that it was my moms birthday and they gave us a complimentary dessert! dessert was eh but the presentation was good. 

overall nice vibe and good price but don’t think I would go back since the menu doesn’t seem to change. I think they have a portobello mushroom meal as well (if you don’t eat steak)","2022-05-23 23:57:48.892599+00:00"
"Móle Mexican bar & grill","False","True","5","my aunt took me here when visiting NY - very cute restaurant with HIGH quality food! We sat outdoors and got a table immediately and I enjoyed the outdoor patio.

I got a passion fruit margarita which tasted really good and complimented the fajitas really well. We got a side of chips and guac which was really filling and good bang for your buck. The shrimp fajitas came out SIZZLING and was cooked perfectly :"")

"Trudy's","False","True","4","got authentic tex mex 😍 portions were solid, I didn't love how much cheese was on the chicken but the corn made it worth. I would probably not get tex mex next time and just get fajitas or tacos. still dope","2022-07-16 22:19:58.080583+00:00"
"Joy's Noodles & Rice","False","True","2","lol so disappointed, but this place had 4 stars on yelp. ordered crab rangoons, panang noodles and pad khee mao. crab rangoons tasted different, they were like air fried but they were pretty good. the panang noodles were confusing they were no noodles in it at all and also didn’t even taste like panang curry!! had a very sus after taste. the pad khee mao were some noodles were vegetables but some of the vegetables tasted super weird and the noodles also didn’t taste great

overall not great experience and won’t be going again. I was so mad I tried to get my money back from Uber eats LMAO","2022-05-31 02:06:07.414205+00:00"

"Mint Heights","False","True","3","wanted to find a place near dumbo and my friends were craving Indian so we went to mint heights - food was good but nothing crazy. probably wouldn’t go again :/ the shrimp curry was the best but butter chicken wasn’t anything special. my veggie friend got palak paneer and dal which was also good. ","2022-09-24 12:00:45.262336+00:00"
"Blue Sushi Sake Grill","False","True","3","went here last night with the homies! the vibes of the restaurant were 10/10, we got drinks that were good but not strong enough (sad). shishito peppers are bomb definitely get but the sushi was like nothing crazy. hovering at a 3.5 but dropped 0.5 because it took a while to get our food. they do have a lot of vegan maki options though! ","2022-04-23 12:11:00.731220+00:00"
"ilili Restaurant","False","True","4","came here to catch up with shreya and the
ambience and food was fantastic. we ordered the labne which tasted AMAZING with the pita. pita was super fresh > 

for the main course, we ordered the brussel sprouts and the chicken tauk duo. the brussel sprouts were heavily recommended by the waiter, but we didn't like it as much as we thought we would. it was still very flavorful but there was a weird balance of walnuts vs the actual brussel sprouts. the chicken was cooked really well though, i was a fan!

we ordered some baklava for dessert which was
also great. overall, the food wasn't life changing so I give it a 4/5 stars but it definitely has a lot of
potential","2022-05-10 02:23:15.210267+00:00"

"Machine Engineered Dining & Drink","False","True","4","came here with some coworkers to grab drinks and I loved the overall experience of machine engineered! First of all, the inside was so PRETTY and had such a vibe - perfect for a fancy dinner or a date.

the drinks were a bit pricey but very ~aesthetic~. I ordered the firebird which came in this very cute glass shaped like a bird. I wish there was more of the drink given but the drink combination was so good - rose vodka, strawberry puree, lemon and triple syrup. My friends got the casually judging (which was definitely a lot less alcohol but very strong) and the fear and loathing (which had a very cute mushroom glass - this one was also good)

knocked off a star because even though the drinks were good, the amount for the price isn't something I would go for every time","2022-05-03 17:26:19.513911+00:00"
"Minghin Cuisine","False","True","5","best dimsum ive had, 10/10 would go again","2022-04-18 20:39:03.991519+00:00"
"Iron Age Korean Steakhouse","False","True","5","walked in around 7:15 pm on a Friday night, and totally underestimated how crowded it was. hour wait (which could be seen by yelp app which was nice)

my friend and I went to grab a drink during the hour - the nice part about wicker park is the ability to casually grab a drink that's a 5 min walk from food.

we did the AYCE dinner special that was SO good! For the sides, we got the spicy rice cakes, japchae and kimchi. All the sides were really good except the japchae - the japchae was cold and not flavored really well to be honest. We ended up ordering multiple orders of the spicy rice cakes (the best side).

the staff was very speedy with getting us the meat and sides that we wanted, which I really appreciated since I was HUNGRY. we tried a ton of meats including beef brisket, pork and beef bulgogi, shrimp and squid. all 10/10

we also got mango and pineapple soju which paired really nicely with the meat. all in all, such a great experience

NOTE : If you end up going, make sure to put your name down a bit earlier and find somewhere to check out during that time.","2022-05-03 17:22:06.393242+00:00"

"Cozy noodles & rice","False","True","4","I've heard AMAZING things about this place and I guarantee it's so good but I just didn't get the right dish for my taste palette LOL 

located in Wrigley and cash only!! ani and I went  right after ~wake and bakery~ and I ordered the crispy pad khee mao. definitely very reasonably priced and such a cute place

I think i prefer noodles to be more saucy so the crispy dryness of the noodles wasn't preferred for me. I know people LOVE this place though so definitely want to go again to check out other dishes (maybe not crispy ones)","2022-08-01 00:27:44.701565+00:00"
"Tortello","False","True","3","I've heard great things about this place but I was
sadly kinda disappointed with the pasta here. The signature tortelli was dry and I couldnt even finish it. they had a spaghetti which was a bit better/flavorful and some bread which was good! Overall 3/5","2022-05-01 12:39:48.867681+00:00"
"Nate's Bagels","False","True","5","my go to bagel place in Richmond!! they only take online orders, so make sure to get your orders in asap since this place is always PACKED. once you get there, you tell them your order number and they will come out with your order. I ordered at 9:30-10 and it was a 20-30 min wait.

my sisters go to is the lox bagel (SO GOOD) and I got their best coast bagel. they hella stuff their bagels so you will be very full lmao. prices are aight I guess, depending on how much stuff you want on you bagel their prices go up

I’ve had their rosemary salt bagel and I’m such a fan, it’s the only time I don’t get an everything bagel","2022-05-15 15:32:40.358744+00:00"
"Patrizia's","False","True","3","this place has bottomless dinner.. still can’t believe that is a concept lol. food was mid as hell but vibes are pretty immaculate. they BLAST throwbacks and it hit. I think a lot of people go here for birthdays which is great because we had a group of like 15 and they accommodated quite well. also learned there’s a vegetarian and non veg menu? which I wish I knew before being disappointed w the food.

"Chalet","False","True","4","came here for dinner with the gorls! the place is cute AF, they also have outdoor seating which was so nice! the restaurant was also open so even though we sat indoors it was still very much an outdoor vibe. my friends ordered espresso martinis which were pretty solid. I got the purple sunset drink which had an aesthetic presentation and was also really great! I have been trying to order less drinks so only got one lmao. 

for food, we got duck confit poutine and fried chicken sandwich. the poutine was SO GOOD, duck was cooked so well and literally melted in my mouth. the fried chicken was so spicy which is surprising because American spicy is usually not spicy for me LOL. had to knock a star because it was literally too spicy for me to eat.

overall great vibes though and would definitely come again","2022-06-04 16:55:14.797380+00:00"
"My Old Dutch","False","True","5","we got some Dutch pancakes from my old Dutch and they were pretty good!! we got one savory and one sweet pancake. the pancakes are a bit bigger but thinner, similar to a crepe!

I believe we got the original (or just like syrup and powdered sugar pancake) and one Mediterranean type pancake. Mediterranean one was definitely interesting but they had SO many options.

they also have a deal on mondays where the pancakes are cheaper!","2022-05-24 01:44:14.739925+00:00"
"Alpana","False","True","4","came here for drinks and vibes with lisna. located pretty close to our apartment and I think it's a relatively new place so it wasn't too crowded,

the drink was really good I forgot the name of it but it had passion fruit! for appetizers we got braised octopus which was SOOO good I wasn't expecting it to be that flavorful. consistency and texture were great and the flavors all complemented well. we also got the crispy polenta and mushrooms, but I wasn't a huge fan of this dish. the mushrooms were good but the polenta wasn't anything crazy. for dessert we got a key lime pie which was good! nothing special 

also this place is priceyyy so be prepared to drop a lot lol","2022-06-12 15:43:05.947822+00:00"
"Au Cheval","False","True","4","came here on a tuesday evening - there was still a really long wait but we put our name down and checked out bombobar in the time being. it took ~45 minutes (conveniently, I live close to fulton so we were also able to go back home during the time)

au cheval had one of the best cheeseburgers ever! I rarely order cheeseburgers at restaurants, but I got a single cheeseburger with a fried egg. the meat was cooked SO well and the meal was so filling. usually a cheeseburger isn't enough to fill me up but this was 10/10. I'm also a BIG fan of pickles on the side

I would go again probably for a special occasion, the line is super annoying but the food is definitely worth it!","2022-05-11 15:57:14.637305+00:00"

for my drink I got the humble tepache #2. It had kind of a unique flavor, almost nutty. I liked it but the drink was too different for my palette.

for food, I got the dos tacos deal with the carnitas and the chicken tacos. Both of them were SO flavorful and had different sauces which I loved! The tortillas were so soft and tasted very fresh, big fan. definitely ordered too much though lol","2022-05-03 17:23:47.146140+00:00"

"1212 Santa Monica","False","True","4","bottomless brunch was FANTASTIC! the outdoor vibes of this restaurant were immaculate. the hostess was very good at refilling our drinks in a timely manner and I say we got our money worth in terms of drinks!  I ordered the oysters and it was my first time having them. they were so so good and I can't believe I'm so late to the oyster game. we ended up ordering 12 for the table and I wish I ordered more.  I also got the eggs benedict with salmon. the salmon was cooked well but the potatoes on the side and the egg itself were fairly mediocre. had to knock off a star for that reason.  5/5 for vibes, 3/5 for food. definitely priced reasonably - if you want a place to party and don't care as much about the food this would be a fantastic spot.","2022-05-11 15:59:30.718100+00:00"

"Di Lieto Sandwich Bar","False","True","5","this is literally the best sandwich I’ve ever had no cap I STILL DREAM ABOUT IT. I would give it 10/5 if I could.

located in holborn (city of london), the place has a long line that does seem to move fairly quickly.  the bakery is super small so it could be easy to miss if you don’t see a line

it is in the area where all the working professionals are so this could be why. everyone who works there is super nice and helpful when it comes to what to order. you can customize the sandwiches with different breads (I got the jalapeño bread) and the bread is so soft!! literally melting in my mouth.

I got their veggie sandwich which has like peppers and onions grilled with I think cream cheese??? so freaking good.

there’s no seating so expect to take it to go!

the vibes of this place were really fun, there are performances every 45 minutes! we got to see guitar, a burlesque show and at the end an acrobatic show.

drinks were fire, we each got 2 tarot card cocktails where there were an interesting mix of liquors. also very reasonably priced

for the table, we ordered the Centesimino Babbo Rosso IGT Ravenna Randi Vini 2019 (really long name) - it was essentially a berry red wine. i usually like all red wines, and this was no different! i really enjoyed the fruity taste, and the wine paired really nicely with my pasta.

being a seafood lover, I knew I was going to get one of their pastas. I LOVED that they included pictures of the food on the menu! I ordered the scoglio, which was spaghetti with shrimps, clams, mussels and calamari sauce. the pasta and the seafood tasted so FRESH which made the dish 10x better.
