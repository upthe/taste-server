"Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe","False","True","5","If you haven't been to wildberry for brunch, it is a Chicago MUST. I usually go there for touristy visits, my sister was visiting and we were craving some good hearty food. The wait time can be long, depending on when you go. We got there at 11 am on a Saturday and had to wait outside for 30 minutes but was so worth!

Once we got inside, we ordered hot chocolate which came instantly and was SO tasty. Also only $4 for a huge mug - steal üòç

my sister and I split the Mexicana skillet and the
chocolate chip and banana pancakes. The food
came out so quickly and everything tasted so fresh. We had so much food and ended up taking most of the pancakes home LOL

I've never had carbonara before, but I loved the concept of having an egg on the top and I felt like it complimented the pasta quite nicely. I'm usually not a fan of pork, but the pork tasted amazing as well!

The burrara and Lemoncello ravioli was very unique in its flavoring but still üëåüèΩ

we all split tiramisu for dessert and that was absolutely amazing. you MUST get it!","2022-05-06 20:09:53.704566+00:00"

"Medium Rare - Arlington","False","True","4","came here for my moms birthday, place has a nice ~aesthetic~ with the lights along the window! we got seated immediately since we had a reservation.

they had a prix fixe menu with bread, salad and steak. I really enjoyed the salad and the steak (the sauce was really good) but the bread was eh in my opinion. my mom and sister got sangria and it tasted good but nothing too special. they gave 2 servings of steak and fries so a lot to take home!

we told the waiter that it was my moms birthday and they gave us a complimentary dessert! dessert was eh but the presentation was good. 

overall nice vibe and good price but don‚Äôt think I would go back since the menu doesn‚Äôt seem to change. I think they have a portobello mushroom meal as well (if you don‚Äôt eat steak)","2022-05-23 23:57:48.892599+00:00"

"ilili Restaurant","False","True","4","came here to catch up with shreya and the
ambience and food was fantastic. we ordered the labne which tasted AMAZING with the pita. pita was super fresh > 

for the main course, we ordered the brussel sprouts and the chicken tauk duo. the brussel sprouts were heavily recommended by the waiter, but we didn't like it as much as we thought we would. it was still very flavorful but there was a weird balance of walnuts vs the actual brussel sprouts. the chicken was cooked really well though, i was a fan!

we ordered some baklava for dessert which was
also great. overall, the food wasn't life changing so I give it a 4/5 stars but it definitely has a lot of
potential","2022-05-10 02:23:15.210267+00:00"

"Machine Engineered Dining & Drink","False","True","4","came here with some coworkers to grab drinks and I loved the overall experience of machine engineered! First of all, the inside was so PRETTY and had such a vibe - perfect for a fancy dinner or a date.

the drinks were a bit pricey but very ~aesthetic~. I ordered the firebird which came in this very cute glass shaped like a bird. I wish there was more of the drink given but the drink combination was so good - rose vodka, strawberry puree, lemon and triple syrup. My friends got the casually judging (which was definitely a lot less alcohol but very strong) and the fear and loathing (which had a very cute mushroom glass - this one was also good)

knocked off a star because even though the drinks were good, the amount for the price isn't something I would go for every time","2022-05-03 17:26:19.513911+00:00"

"Iron Age Korean Steakhouse","False","True","5","walked in around 7:15 pm on a Friday night, and totally underestimated how crowded it was. hour wait (which could be seen by yelp app which was nice)

my friend and I went to grab a drink during the hour - the nice part about wicker park is the ability to casually grab a drink that's a 5 min walk from food.

we did the AYCE dinner special that was SO good! For the sides, we got the spicy rice cakes, japchae and kimchi. All the sides were really good except the japchae - the japchae was cold and not flavored really well to be honest. We ended up ordering multiple orders of the spicy rice cakes (the best side).

the staff was very speedy with getting us the meat and sides that we wanted, which I really appreciated since I was HUNGRY. we tried a ton of meats including beef brisket, pork and beef bulgogi, shrimp and squid. all 10/10

we also got mango and pineapple soju which paired really nicely with the meat. all in all, such a great experience

located in Wrigley and cash only!! ani and I went  right after ~wake and bakery~ and I ordered the crispy pad khee mao. definitely very reasonably priced and such a cute place

"Tortello","False","True","3","I've heard great things about this place but I was

my sisters go to is the lox bagel (SO GOOD) and I got their best coast bagel. they hella stuff their bagels so you will be very full lmao. prices are aight I guess, depending on how much stuff you want on you bagel their prices go up

"Chalet","False","True","4","came here for dinner with the gorls! the place is cute AF, they also have outdoor seating which was so nice! the restaurant was also open so even though we sat indoors it was still very much an outdoor vibe. my friends ordered espresso martinis which were pretty solid. I got the purple sunset drink which had an aesthetic presentation and was also really great! I have been trying to order less drinks so only got one lmao. 

for food, we got duck confit poutine and fried chicken sandwich. the poutine was SO GOOD, duck was cooked so well and literally melted in my mouth. the fried chicken was so spicy which is surprising because American spicy is usually not spicy for me LOL. had to knock a star because it was literally too spicy for me to eat.

overall great vibes though and would definitely come again","2022-06-04 16:55:14.797380+00:00"
"My Old Dutch","False","True","5","we got some Dutch pancakes from my old Dutch and they were pretty good!! we got one savory and one sweet pancake. the pancakes are a bit bigger but thinner, similar to a crepe!

I believe we got the original (or just like syrup and powdered sugar pancake) and one Mediterranean type pancake. Mediterranean one was definitely interesting but they had SO many options.

they also have a deal on mondays where the pancakes are cheaper!","2022-05-24 01:44:14.739925+00:00"
"Alpana","False","True","4","came here for drinks and vibes with lisna. located pretty close to our apartment and I think it's a relatively new place so it wasn't too crowded,

the drink was really good I forgot the name of it but it had passion fruit! for appetizers we got braised octopus which was SOOO good I wasn't expecting it to be that flavorful. consistency and texture were great and the flavors all complemented well. we also got the crispy polenta and mushrooms, but I wasn't a huge fan of this dish. the mushrooms were good but the polenta wasn't anything crazy. for dessert we got a key lime pie which was good! nothing special 

also this place is priceyyy so be prepared to drop a lot lol","2022-06-12 15:43:05.947822+00:00"

au cheval had one of the best cheeseburgers ever! I rarely order cheeseburgers at restaurants, but I got a single cheeseburger with a fried egg. the meat was cooked SO well and the meal was so filling. usually a cheeseburger isn't enough to fill me up but this was 10/10. I'm also a BIG fan of pickles on the side

I would go again probably for a special occasion, the line is super annoying but the food is definitely worth it!","2022-05-11 15:57:14.637305+00:00"

located in holborn (city of london), the place has a long line that does seem to move fairly quickly.  the bakery is super small so it could be easy to miss if you don‚Äôt see a line

it is in the area where all the working professionals are so this could be why. everyone who works there is super nice and helpful when it comes to what to order. you can customize the sandwiches with different breads (I got the jalape√±o bread) and the bread is so soft!! literally melting in my mouth.
