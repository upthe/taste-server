"Chatayee Thai","False","True","5","Creative Thai menu - almost fusion. Menu changes quarterly allowing for a wider range of items to taste. Menu also allows for a balance of options for Vegan to meat eaters in my family. 

Location: in the heart of center city Philly with engaged owners and patient servers. Ambience is reasonable. Walking distance to parking, City Hall, dessert places ","2022-06-23 19:41:48.178844+00:00"
"Mango Mango Dessert","False","True","5","If you like mangoes, then this dessert place is a must try. Has a bunch of vegan options too. We tried Oreo mille crepe and mango-taro-lychee bowl. There are over 50 more items in the menu too. Sit down or take out. Nice place to walk to after a meal in China town ","2022-07-31 00:10:14.864881+00:00"
"Añejo Philadelphia","False","True","5","￼Clearly a distinctive Mexican restaurant - It was rated #1 Mexican in Philadelphia in 2021. Great vibe; menu isn’t typical of Mexican restaurants - more traditional Mexican. We had the Octopus tostada and Beef Birria tacos (the dip was very flavorful- had a taste of Indian coriander masala!). The vegan cauliflower tacos were crunchy but needed more flavor (adding the various salsas helped). We sat outside… nice July evening weather in Philly, but the street noise was a bit loud at times. Mark this place as a must have experience in Philly ","2022-07-09 01:58:49.359683+00:00"
