"Liberty Bagels","False","True","5","Jalapeño everything bagel,  veggie cream cheese. Order and repeat, it is sooo good! I think I’ve taken every single visitor I’ve had in NYC to this spot. ","2022-05-06 00:22:20.716171+00:00"
"Totto Ramen","False","True","5","Literally the best ramen I’ve ever had (London and NYC combined) and I’ve been there 4 times now and they are consistent with quality! The ramen almost has this creaminess to it and it’s just delicious. Don’t order it for takeaway, even though everything comes separately, it’s wayyy better having it at the restaurant!

"AÑEJO","False","True","5","I really enjoyed Añejo - it was a local vibey place for me in Hell’s Kitchen and the food was really tasty. I loved their small plates that made having a diverse set of dishes for dinner a lot easier to order! ","2022-04-23 14:07:11.029532+00:00"
"Playa Betty's","False","True","3","The food was pretty good and we had a cheap bottomless deal for brunch which was great, but the service was so so - it took them ages to fill us up and we had to keep following up with them! ","2022-05-06 00:20:36.771914+00:00"
