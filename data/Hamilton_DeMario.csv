"The Italian Place","False","True","5","The Chicken Parmesan has quickly become my favorite sub. I’ve been there twice for it and it’s so good each time. The chicken is quality and tender with good breading. The bread is tasty and soft. Definitely add olive oil and Italian seasoning. It’s a simple sandwich but they get it right.

"Quickway Japanese Hibachi","False","True","5","I’d here before but it had been a while. 100% still slaps. I got a chicken and beef hibachi with fried rice and veggies. The meat was nice and tender and all together it was super flavorful. The reason it gets 5 stars though is for the portion sizes. Lots of food (and meat specifically) for not a ton of money. Definitely worth. My gf got the bento box, and paid maybe $2 more for even more food: sushi, dumplings, and spring rolls.","2022-05-26 14:33:30.275300+00:00"
"Mom & Pop","False","True","5","The dulce de leche is definitely one of my favorite lattes now! Plus great outdoor seating!","2022-04-19 23:58:50.578557+00:00"
"Bansari Indian Cuisine","False","True","4","The butter chicken was good, not great. Medium spicy was not spicy at all imo. They gave a good amount of protein which was nice. I’d definitely give the place another shot and try something else. ","2022-04-24 02:53:49.384735+00:00"
