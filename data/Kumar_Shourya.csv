"The Rib Co.","False","True","4","BBQ done right. We had the baby back ribs, prime rib and pulled pork sandwiches along with sides of coleslaw and beans. The meats were very tender, yet bread quality couldâ€™ve been better. For dessert, we had the classic peach cobbler pie and left extremely satisfied. Would highly recommend this spot.","2022-06-09 03:24:48.305042+00:00"
"Multnomah Whiskey Library","False","True","5","Amazing experience. The whiskey sommeliers are well versed in the flavor profiles and suggest unique whiskeys based on your preferences and palate. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a more personalized drinking experience. The progression and bouquet of flavors the Loch Lomond 12, Caol Ila 15 and Laphroaig 10 Cask Strength was remarkable.","2022-05-23 02:34:34.211934+00:00"
"Killer Noodle","False","True","4","Awesome Asian fusion noodle spot for those with a penchant for spice. I tried the Tokyo style dry noodles at the standard spice level and greatly enjoyed it.","2022-06-09 03:27:15.144648+00:00"
