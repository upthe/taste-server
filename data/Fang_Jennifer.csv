"Blue Willow","False","True","4","I went here last year w randy and it was so beat but @leon wanted to try it again. Alas this man only told me 2 hours beforehand and invited 3 other ppl (glad he invited @claire though - Iâ€™m not complaining) so we had to sit OUTSIDE IN THE 95 DEGREE HEAT â€¦ food was much better this time though and Iâ€™d love to go back and try the stews (we couldnâ€™t order them though we we were already getting hotboxed in the outdoor seating zzzzz)  ","2022-07-24 19:55:27.499531+00:00"
