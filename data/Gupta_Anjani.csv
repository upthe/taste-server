4/5 for rest of the food. The brown bread they give at the table is shockingly good but rest of the food wasn’t that great. Maybe I ordered the wrong things, I hear the Chipotle pasta is good? ","2022-04-30 17:14:24.547953+00:00"

We went for brunch twice, and got their Cherry blossom tea set once (you have to specially request this 48 hours in advance via email, AFTER securing a reservation first - so it needs a bit of planning).
