"Whole Foods Market","False","True","5","Crowded as expected on a Sunday but surprisingly well stocked! Had everything I wanted and a lot of options. Decided to try some new brands because of the Prime discounts. So far, no moldy produce üëÄüëÄ","2022-09-11 23:23:19.653167+00:00"
"Chipotle Mexican Grill","False","True","5","This is a particularly good chipotle. The food was very fresh and colorful. Chipotle can be hit or miss (although usually hit tbh) and this was a real home run. Guac was green, romaine crunchy, chicken well charred. Yummmmm I love Chipotle, especially on a road trip. One note - the to-go order did not include utensils which could have been a problem had we not thought to check. Props to the employee who did not laugh when we asked for ‚Äúsilverware‚Äù.
