"ChÃ¢teau de Chantilly","False","True","4","The coffee is good, not exquisite. The pastries though are wonderful! They have so many options for both savory and sweet varieties, and all of the ones I tried are great! If you go on a weekend morning, beware the the lines can get long and if you go too late, theyâ€™ll run out of pastries and youâ€™ll be sad ","2022-05-17 20:36:40.576673+00:00"
"Granby Waffle Shop","False","True","2","There were eggshells in my rice bowlâ€¦ Iâ€™d give it one star, but the waffles other people had around me looked decent.","2022-05-17 20:33:06.456788+00:00"
"Choongman Chicken","False","True","4","The chicken was juicy on the inside and perfectly fried on the outside. The spicy sauce was not quite spicy enough (for me), and was a bit on the sweeter side, but overall really good fried chicken. The cheesy monster fries were a great side also - great seasoning!

The only con was that it was a lotttt of food and even two of us couldnâ€™t finish one order ðŸ™ƒ","2022-05-17 20:30:14.403089+00:00"
