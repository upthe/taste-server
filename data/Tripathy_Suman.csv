"Shuggie's","False","True","4","The pizzas were really unique and cool! Super thin and crispy. I was pretty hungry after sharing 2 pizzas among 4 people though. Cauliflower apps were also super good!","2022-05-06 17:04:31.091616+00:00"

"San Marzano Pasta Fresca","False","True","5","Honestly my favorite Italian place still. Affordable, cute, fun. Sangria pitchers were cheaper than a single drink other places. Pappardelle with vecchia bettola is the GOAT","2022-06-10 17:18:38.987526+00:00"
