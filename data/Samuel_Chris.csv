"The Court of Two Sisters","False","True","5","Jazz music and good food?! A killer combo. Servers had amazing energy. Jambalaya, crawfish, in house ice cream were ON POINT👌🏿 It’s a buffet style and I’m ashamed that my stomach couldn’t fit everything there! Definitely going back 😋","2022-06-20 21:44:02.521878+00:00"
