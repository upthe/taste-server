"McDonald's","False","True","4","McDonald's in India never fails to disappoint. There is a new Mc Spicy Paneer burger with jalapenos and lettuce which was one of the best items on there. The piri piri fries are great as well. Only down side is that they are very stringent on giving ketchup packets.","2022-08-22 05:22:07.263646+00:00"
"Nostra Cucina","False","True","2","Overall this place looked decent. We were expecting good food but nothing spectacular but even then this place didn't hit the mark. We got 2 things - Pesto Fettuccine and Eggplant Parmesan. The prices were expensive as well but we figured that's DC for you. However what we got wouldn't justify any price. 

The eggplant parmesan was pretty bland, not flavorful at all. We had to add a lot of chili flakes to get some sort of flavor out of it but at that point we were just tasting the spice and the eggplant parmesan taste still wasn't present.

The pesto fettuccine was even worse. It felt like we ordered olive oil with a side of pesto fettuccine. I literally had to take my plate and drain the oil into another container. Even after that it wasn't worth it. The pesto did have some flavor but the oiliness of the pasta was a huge let down even after draining the oil. Each bite I took would coat my mouth in olive oil and left a horrible feeling in my mouth. Would not recommend. ","2022-07-25 19:22:58.296904+00:00"
"Pi Pizzeria","False","True","4","First time having deep dish pizza. It was actually really good. The normal thin crust pizza was nice and crispy as well. Definitely worth getting again. Only down side is that it was a bit on the expensive side but that's DC for you.","2022-07-20 03:25:03.547028+00:00"
