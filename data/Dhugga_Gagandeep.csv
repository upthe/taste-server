"KIKI","False","True","5","Loved the ambiance and the food! Lamb chops were cooked perfectly, not overdone. Also order the Zues mule drink, which is a Moscow mule, and is not overpowering with the ginger beer. Magician came by the table and offered a show, which as a person who loves magic, really enjoyed! Overall, recommend if you want to have a good time. ","2022-05-22 01:18:32.676247+00:00"
