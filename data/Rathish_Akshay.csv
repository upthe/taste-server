"The Brooklyn Tree","False","True","5","Great brunch food and sandwiches, lowkey vibe but 100% recommend. You should get the gazpaucho as your side dish","2022-06-25 21:53:46.830525+00:00"
"The 13th Step","False","True","5","Went here for Warriors game 6 and the vibes were great but the place was so packed it took 30 minutes to even get a single drink. Regardless beers and seltzers were only $4-5 a piece so good place for some casual drinks during a game just try to go early so you can get a place to sit down ","2022-06-20 17:01:04.384705+00:00"
"Bushwick Pita Palace","False","True","4","Huge selection of Mediterranean and Mexican food, the lamb gyro wrap is my go-to there","2022-06-20 02:34:24.316406+00:00"
"La Pecora Bianca","False","True","5","Amazing spot for Italian food, little bit on the pricier side but worth it. The spicy rigatoni is a must get and you should add the burrata, really creamy and makes the entire dish come together. You can also get the burrata as an appetizer if you just want a taste","2022-06-20 16:59:02.933034+00:00"
"Tacombi - Nolita","False","True","4","This place would have been a 5 if the ambience was a bit better. Food was solid for Mexican in NY though (especially their salsas) lots of flavor. Breakfast taco with Al pastor was the best I had ","2022-06-21 02:29:00.720476+00:00"
