"Tony's Pizza Napoletana","False","True","3","Came highly recommended as the “best pizza in SF.” The restaurant was cool - definitely a place you could enjoy a beer in. My issue is with the food - a $40 pizza did not taste as good a little Cesar’s $5 hot & ready. ","2022-06-07 03:36:37.127428+00:00"
