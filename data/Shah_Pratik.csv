"Melting Pot Pizza","False","True","4","This is the go-to pizza place for locals in this small town in western Virginia. I honestly had low expectations when trying this place but was quite impressed at the quality of this pizza. We ordered two pizzas - one with their signature Pizzaz sauce and another with Alfredo sauce. The Pizzaz sauce is a slightly spicier and more garlicy version of traditional pizza sauce with adds a nice kick to the pizza. The Alfredo was the typical creamy goodness. The pizza was a crispy thin crust that kepts it's shape even though we had 4 toppings on the pizza with Pizzaz sauce. The one unique thing about this place is that it had square slices but surprisingly didn't get very messy. Besides the pizzas we ordered a side of garlic bread with Pizzaz dipping sauce which also slapped. I would definitely eat here again if I'm back in the area. ","2022-06-14 14:21:50.400350+00:00"
"Samarcanda Ristorante Pizzeria","False","True","5","Cool vibes and atmosphere at this pizzeria. They have some great tasting pizzas on their menu. I personally really liked the margherita pizza, quattro formaggio pizza, and their classic bruschetta.","2022-05-15 20:48:41.295850+00:00"
"Wen","False","True","5","This sushi place makes you feel like you're in a New York restaurant. They have some really cool interior designing. Besides the atmosphere, they have some great vegetarian options as some really cool plating.  ","2022-05-15 21:15:15.692980+00:00"
"Tadashi Japanese Restaurant","False","True","4","Good vegetarian ramen in State College. Miso soup, non-creamy broth with vegetables and noodles. Nothing special here but it is hard to find good vegetarian ramen, most places are sub-par.","2022-08-15 13:30:59.917719+00:00"
"Tape Italian Taste","False","True","5","Unlimited plates for €25, need I say more? They have over 25 different options to choose from and you can order 3 to 4 plates at a time. Each item is a small plate so allows you to try many different things. They have Italian food, burgers, and small pan pizzas on the all you can eat menu. They even have a vegetarian section with over 8 options!","2022-05-15 20:57:16.802484+00:00"
"El Changarro","False","True","5","Really good Mexican food behind a Mexican grocery store. Hole in the wall place using fresh ingredients! Got some great vegetarian options too! My coworkers and I go here at least once a month for lunch.","2022-05-15 20:45:08.998610+00:00"
"Pita Cabana Grill","False","True","4","Good Mediterranean restaurant with bowls and wraps offered. One thing they do different from other places is that they put pickles in your wrap/bowls. Falafels were crispy and had a great taste too.","2022-08-11 18:06:18.755474+00:00"
"Nori Ramen & Poke Bowl","False","True","4","Had the vegan ramen here and it was good. Not something I'd recommend someone else to go to but good enough to eat at if I'm craving some ramen near home. Asked them to add the spicy miso paste and chili oil which they did for free. The veggie dumplings in the ramen were really good! They have the dumplings on the menu too so I might order that next time. ","2022-05-25 14:32:52.927318+00:00"
"Cozy Thai Bistro","False","True","4","Honestly I had very low expectations for Thai food in state college but this place had really good panang curry. It was extremely creamy and had just the right amount of spice level to it. The tofu was a bit too chewy and the only vegetable in the curry was green beans. If these two things were fixed this place is an easy 5 stars!","2022-08-11 18:11:20.072253+00:00"
"Place One Chinese and Thai Restaurant","False","True","3","Got some panang curry and it was alright, probably won't eat here again since there are better Thai places nearby. The cool thing was they gave you fried rice chips with sweet and sour sauce as a free appetizer kinda like chips and salsa vibe.","2022-05-25 14:36:20.931606+00:00"
"Roots Natural Kitchen","False","True","5","Roots always hits the spot and the one in state college did not disappoint. I'd describe Roots as a healthy, tasty restaurant where they serve salad/grain bowls. I typically get the Southern and ask to add Sriracha for a little kick. ","2022-08-11 17:58:02.124329+00:00"
"Dosa Express","False","True","2","Yeah so I finally found a restaurant in state college that truly disappointed. It's the only south Indian restaurant in the college town and so I decided to give it a try with my coworker. The dosa was crispy but the batter used was not smooth and so it had patches of thickness. The sambhar was subpar and instead of coconut chutney we were given an extremely salty mint chutney. ","2022-08-11 18:16:06.428215+00:00"
"Reen's Delicatessen","False","True","4","Reen's has a solid vegetarian hoagie that they load with vegetables. You have to typically ask for more than their standard lettuce, tomato, and onion but usually they also add red cabbage, black olives, cucumber, pickles, hot peppers, and banana peppers. I usually ask for pepper jack cheese and balsamic vinaigrette which makes for a solid lunch for only $5.50.","2022-07-11 18:18:54.082777+00:00"
"Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba","False","True","5","I only had tapas at this place but the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce is literally so good. We had 4 orders of that in our group of 4. Additionally the fried shisto peppers taste amazing and the gazpacho soup taste like chole. Not sure how the paella taste but definitely recommend this place to eat tapas!","2022-05-30 02:57:29.134917+00:00"
"Cafe 210 West","False","True","5","If you are looking for drinks this is the place. They have daily pitcher specials I went on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday while I was in State College. On Monday and Thursday they have $5 spiked tea pitchers where you can choose a flavor of your choice. On Wednesday they have $7 vodka wells pitchers. These pitchers definitely hit and are dirt cheap. Highly recommend for a good night!","2022-08-15 13:33:37.933834+00:00"
"El Jefe’s Taqueria","False","True","5","This is a Mexican bowl place similar to Chipotle or Qdoba. However this place has real hot sauces that make their bowls amazing. Their ingredients seem very fresh as well. Definitely some place I'd go again the next time I'm in State College.","2022-08-11 17:58:56.768676+00:00"
"Are U Hungry","False","True","3","This is a fat sandwich place - basically a roll with fries, Mozzerella Sticks, Mac n cheese bits, and/or onion rings with some vegetables. I frequently go to the R U Hungry at Rutgers and so wanted to try this one as well. Overall the sandwich was pretty dry and they don't offer any vegetarian options. I had to mod one of the non-vegetarian sandwiches instead to make it with fries, mozz sticks, and Mac n cheese bites.","2022-08-11 17:51:46.069298+00:00"
