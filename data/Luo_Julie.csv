"Thai Diner","False","True","5","Finally tried this place out and it did not disappoint! We got there at 10:30am for brunch to avoid the lines and it was perfect - no wait. Ordered the egg sandwich (egg, sausage, and Thai basil wrapped in homemade roti) which was amazing, and the Thai French toast which was okay!","2022-07-25 15:06:18.529459+00:00"
