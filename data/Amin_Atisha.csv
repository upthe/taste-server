"Taco Zocalo","False","True","5","This is a really small place but there tacos are some of the best I've had. I got the chicken tinga, chorizo, and grilled chicken tacos. They were really good and the portion sizes are generous. I believe it was ~$12 for 3 tacos which is definitely filling for dinner. One suggestion if you like spicy food is to ask for the extra hot sauce. They give you 2 hot sauces when you pay and since I like spicy food, I found those 2 sauces flavorful and tangy but not spicy. Their extra-hot sauce though was definitely spicy and went really well with the tacos.","2022-06-20 21:52:24.858219+00:00"
