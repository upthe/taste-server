"El Centro","False","True","1","Might have been bc of Fourth of July weekend but one of the worst dining experiences I’ve ever had. Food came late, salsas had no flavor, nachos came without cheese, and then to top it all off they closed the kitchen without taking our order for entrees and never bothered to tell us the kitchen was closing. Had been to the other location before pre Covid which was good but wow the one in Georgetown sucks. Don’t ever come here","2022-07-03 02:11:26.880926+00:00"
