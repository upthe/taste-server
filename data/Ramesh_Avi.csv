"Spicy Moon","False","True","5","This is restandardizing my rating system. Phenomenal food, from the crabless Rangoon to the Dan Dan noodles. Cocktails (got a mango rum and a thyme drink that I’m forgetting) and mocktails (lychee) were super refreshing as well. Def want to go back with people who like mushrooms and tofu more and further explore the menu ","2022-05-08 00:26:36.750441+00:00"
"Bluestone Lane","False","True","2","Do not go here - they have a kiosk that is ridiculously annoying to leave (2 people left because of how frustrating it was), shivi’s card said approved but wasn’t, and they wouldn’t let you order in person ","2022-05-24 17:56:24.252290+00:00"
"Dos Toros Taqueria","False","True","3","Food is great - consistent with most dis toros locations and above and far better than chipotle (fresher beans, farro, fresher veggies). 3 Stars because as a vegetarian I get bits of steak in my bowl ~10-20% if the time","2022-05-05 18:16:43.011119+00:00"
