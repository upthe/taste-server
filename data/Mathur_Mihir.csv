"Bhoga","False","True","4","Tried North Indian vegetarian at Bhoga with @Uma and I thought the food was good. It seemed pricier than other comparable Indian restaurants in the Bay Area and a bit targeted towards non-Indians. Service could’ve been a little better.","2022-05-27 05:24:26.845089+00:00"

"Empress by Boon","False","True","5","Delicious Cantonese inspired dishes, amazing ambiance, great views, superb service, nice cocktails! Each dish was so well presented too: for example, the squid and fish dumplings were shaped like a squid and fish. 

Its extremely expensive, but worth the experience imo.","2022-07-18 01:07:03.866314+00:00"
