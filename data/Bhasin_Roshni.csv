"Tsurutontan Udon Noodle Brasserie","False","True","4","Noodle bowl was very large and dramatic (see photo) but the food was actually very good and spicy/flavorful - huge menu too with happy hour options as well (on food & drinks)","2022-07-15 01:17:34.629709+00:00"
"Gazab","False","True","4","Ordered the dahi puri, chicken wings, and lamb salli boti, then ordered the chicken biryani in the middle of our meal bc we saw everyone else ordering it lol (and it was FIRE). Could barely function after / needed a nap but overall food was great!! Will definitely go again 
Also this restaurant is where the old Masalawala used to be #iykyk","2022-05-06 00:13:09.672067+00:00"
"Nowon","False","True","4","Really great Korean fusion restaurant with nice cocktails and a fun atmosphere - we had to wait a bit for our table but the service was really great otherwise and they gave us a round of drinks/ apps on the house because of the wait. Some of the best food items here are the Korean fried chicken, chicken sandwich, legendary burger, rice cakes ","2022-07-10 16:34:43.412374+00:00"
"ZIZI","False","True","4","Food was really good- got some standard dips/appetizer and this lamb flatbread entree which was amazing, have never had anything like it!! Service was a little slow though and we had to wait ~25 min even with a reservation (but we 
 got free drinks bc of that)","2022-05-06 00:16:00.014412+00:00"
"Adda Indian Canteen","False","True","5","This is probably some of the best Indian food I’ve had, in nyc or otherwise- it’s owned by the same people as Dhamaka and Semma. It’s in Long Island city but definitely worth the trip and relatively easy to get a reservation at considering it’s always packed.

Some of my favorite dishes here are the dahi puri, goat biryani, aloo Chana chaat, goat curry- have been here 3 or 4 times and quality is consistently good- highly recommend Adda!","2022-05-16 04:47:48.469552+00:00"
"Dhamaka","False","True","4","It was pretty good but definitely overhyped- think you get better food at Adda for ~half the price and no issues getting reservations there. Music vibes and drinks are Dhamaka are all very nice though, would go again if it becomes easier to get a reservation ","2022-05-16 03:13:35.263638+00:00"
"Adyar Ananda Bhavan","False","True","4","Honestly this place is better than Sarvana Bhavan- has really good quality and variety of dosas and all your classic South Indian dishes, very good chai as well. Restaurant doesn’t have great service and the ambiance is a bit casual but the food is amazing! One of my go to comfort food places  ","2022-05-16 03:19:22.469280+00:00"
"Osteria Cotta","False","True","5","One of my favorite Italian spots in the city - the gnocchi and the lasagna are both amazing, everything is really nicely prepared and it’s a very cozy restaurant- they also have daily arancini balls and burrata which are both great ","2022-07-10 16:36:52.489400+00:00"
"Carbone","False","True","4","We got the spicy rigatoni and the tortellini ragu, both were excellent! Will definitely try to go again- the appetizer bread /Parmesan crisps they bring out were also surprisingly good. We sat outside but the ambiance was still very nice and service was great ","2022-05-16 03:15:02.856920+00:00"
"Ponche Taqueria & Cantina","False","True","4","This place is a total hole in the wall- probably some of the best Mexican food I’ve had in nyc but very small restaurant and casual ambiance. Super reasonable prices - would recommend the enchiladas suizas and the ponche pork quesadilla","2022-05-16 03:17:24.376511+00:00"
