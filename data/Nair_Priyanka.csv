"Mr. Boil","False","True","4","Super random combo restaurant: poke bowls and Cajun seafood (crawfish mainly). I went with 3 friends and all of us got the custom poke bowls. Very comparable prices with other poke places, fresh ingredients, and quick service! Only giving 4 stars because I haven’t tried the other half of the menu offerings but there were plenty of people there for the Cajun seafood so I’ll have to go back and try it out.

"Erva's","False","True","5","Amazing, fresh mojitos!! Their habanero hot sauce is made fresh in house too - bf recommends (since I don’t do spicy). All the food was incredible, take the waiter’s recs he’s spot on and super sweet & soft spoken dude! Just tell him which protein you want and he’ll tell you which preparation is best (coconut, curry, or creole). ","2022-05-17 23:38:55.701438+00:00"
"Ñoño’s Taqueria","False","True","5","The BEST birria tacos in nova!!! Literally so much flavor, it’s mouth watering just when it comes out. So you have to order each taco you want and then order the consomé (soup/dip thing) separately. I personally loved the shrimp taco more than the beef, they also have chicken tinga which I didn’t try but my friends got it and loved it. Big size tacos so the price is fair. They also do street corn which is insanely good and sold on the cob (didn’t get a pic). Honestly kind of a hole in the wall spot outside the trendy part of Arlington but so so good. ","2022-05-27 01:58:14.521984+00:00"
"Lebanese Kitchen","False","True","5","Made a last minute decision to grab lunch here. Pretty big portions and decent pricing for delish Mediterranean food! I got the Mediterranean rice bowl with both chicken shawarma and falafel. This was probably some of the best/freshly made falafel I’ve ever had. They also make fresh pistachio baklava in house which was so so good and not overly sweet. My friend got the Turkish coffee and said it hit the spot too. ","2022-05-27 18:18:37.046308+00:00"
"Aago @ CNU","False","True","5","First of probs many trips to Aago. It’s Indian/Nepalese cuisine in Newport News (come visit me in residency thx). Literally the BEST gobi manchurian, samosa chaat, and mango lassi I’ve had in my life. Flavors through the roof, I always order spice 3 (medium) bc I don’t have any spice tolerance but they are known for making things real spicy for anyone who’s into that. Mango lassi was perfect sweetness level, not too sweet that you get sick of it halfway through the glass and not so thick that it’s like a milkshake. Veg pakoras, mixed grill kebab platter, and chicken momos were decent nothing special. Overall def coming back for the notable items and gotta try their biryani which is apparently amaze but too full to try today.  ","2022-05-29 22:09:39.381950+00:00"
"Hibisca Restaurant","False","True","5","Live music (amazing singers) and sizzling hot food - not Belizean cuisine more mixed bag but solid spot on the main strip in Caye Caulker","2022-05-17 23:20:51.425650+00:00"
"Simply Social Coffee - Vienna","False","True","4","Great spot for studying or catching up with a friend, indoor and outdoor space. Typical prices for coffee in nova - I got the basic caramel iced latte w/ oat milk and it didn’t disappoint","2022-05-23 23:09:30.232383+00:00"
"Midtown Restaurant & Bar","False","True","3","Extremely average food for a very high price. They have a sister restaurant Lucca’s that’s across the street. The menu for both are identical but Lucca’s has better views being oceanfront. Pretty much American bar menu at American prices but we’re in Belize so it’s less than ideal. Belize city in general seems overpriced for food/drinks so just avoid staying in the area if you can - better food at great prices in San Ignacio and Caye Caulker as seen on my other reviews! ","2022-05-19 23:45:08.724012+00:00"
"Navíos","False","True","5","High end restaurant right on the water in Cancun. This was my first time eating risotto and squid ink but truly a delish dish - flavors I wasn’t expecting especially because the ink made the dish not look as varied/intricate as it tasted. Fam got the other dishes pictured and everyone loved it. Mom doesn’t eat seafood so there were non-pesce options that were solid too. Overall ambiance w/ the ocean breeze and tiki hut aesthetic made it a 10/10. ","2022-06-11 03:02:35.454745+00:00"
"The Qui Korean Grille","False","True","5","My first ever kbbq experience was here and it was truly amazing. Flavors 1000/10. You have to get the all you can eat special ($34/person) bc otherwise why are you even going to kbbq. We tried so many proteins: spicy pork belly, spicy beef bulgogi, beef brisket, and masala honey butter chicken are all delish. Avoid the shrimp and spicy baby octopus, 0/10. Special shout-out to the corn cheese!!! Literally could eat just that and be my happiest. I don’t have any pics sadly but I did make a tiktok for this place lol so check it out there 🤪","2022-05-25 02:21:30.574295+00:00"
"Aago @ CNU","False","True","5","Back again. Tasted some new items so wanted to share: chicken saag 1000/10 the chicken was so tender it just fell apart with a fork and great flavor, goat vindaloo apparently best flavored curry we got per my dad/brother, malai kofta 5/10 just have had better at other restaurants and home made which was disappointing but overall 90% of the stuff I’ve had here is amaze","2022-07-31 00:41:27.178885+00:00"
"Sakatomo Sushi","False","True","5","Great sushi and Japanese food spot. All of us ordered a non sushi entrée but a few ordered sushi as their app. All the entrées came with miso soup and salad with the classic ginger dressing. But this was legit the BEST miso soup I’ve had, I usually take a spoonful and leave the rest but every single one of us were tilting our bowls to get the last couple drops. We got either chicken or salmon teriyaki or chicken katsu +/- don. My friends brought their 2 month old baby who’s perfect and the Asian waitress was obsessed with him - she gave us complimentary chocolate mochi at the end (I truly think it’s bc she loved the baby so much lol). But ya solid spot, food doesn’t disappoint, they do a lunch sushi special which makes the sushi a little more affordable as an entrée option. ","2022-06-18 11:23:50.545717+00:00"
"Aago @ CNU","False","True","5","Back at this spot again. Still 5/5 stars. Got the gobi manchurian, samosa chaat, and mango lassi again - they all still smack. Also tried the butter chicken, shrimp biryani, and veg korma w garlic naan. Literally only good things to say - took my 2 co-interns and attending with me (all non-Indian) and they were obsessed. Also the complimentary pappad w chutney is 10/10. ","2022-06-22 21:15:49.334372+00:00"
"Bambu Tee Belize","False","True","5","Delish bubble tea in downtown San Ignacio, recommend the Thai tea flavor! ","2022-05-17 23:18:02.875391+00:00"
"Praline Bakery Mosaic","False","True","4","Cute bakery hidden at the back of Mosaic district. Sell specialty cookies, brownies, cakes, croissants, and macarons. It’s also a café but with all the other coffee spots in Mosaic idk who’d go here for the coffee. I tried the praline cookie (figured it was the specialty bc name) and it was super good - soft and buttery, quite sweet. My friend has gotten a few other cookies and loved all the flavors she’d tried. Seems a little overpriced but expected in Mosaic. ","2022-05-27 02:07:34.567677+00:00"
"Mellow Mushroom","False","True","5","Okay I’ve been to a mellow mushroom in Blacksburg and truly did not enjoy my experience so this was a big surprise. I shared the Big Dipper (brand new summer app, literally released on the menu TODAY) and holy shiitake small pie w a friend. Incredible flavors, love my shrooms and they were plentiful. The guy making the order in the kitchen screwed up and accidentally made the pie medium instead of small so we came home with leftovers free of charge 🤗 (Big Dipper was pineapple salsa, guac, and basically bruschetta topping served w garlic bread and chips) ","2022-06-21 23:02:56.294924+00:00"
"NEST Kitchen & Taphouse","False","True","5","Delish brunch spot. The staple brunch items but with little unique additions that elevate the cuisine. I got the poutine hash: sweet potato fries, cheese curds, scallions, gravy, and 2 eggs any style. They gave us a complimentary slice of coffee cake too! Amazing flavors, big portions, and super aesthetic spot located right next to a golf course in one of the nicest/safest neighborhoods in Newport News. ","2022-07-09 19:13:40.037204+00:00"
"TASTE","False","True","5","Solid sandwich/salad/soup spot in Newport News. They have a regular menu of sandwiches (various proteins, including veg) and a biweekly rotating specials menu. I got the lynnhaven sandwich - grilled chicken, a hefty layer of pimento cheese, bacon, spinach, tomato and basil mayo on ciabatta. Great flavors, good portion size and I reheated half the sandwich the next night for dinner and was still 10/10. I got a fruit salad side and all the fruit were sweet and fresh for a decent portion as well! Will be a regular spot for me over the next few years.","2022-06-10 10:38:50.857293+00:00"
"Al Fresco","False","True","4","Solid Italian food spot, fine dining vibe. (Showed up in workout clothes and we were very out of place). The apps and entrées were delish, entrée portions were huge - everyone had leftovers including my friends who never usually do. Super sweet waitress and prompt service. Went for dinner, they have a special where you get a free app if you buy 2 entrées.  They do the classic breadsticks and salad before the meal - extremely underwhelming on both hence the downgrade to 4 stars. ","2022-06-17 00:50:17.701794+00:00"
"TASTE","False","True","5","Visited here again today as I said I would. Actually went to the restaurant irl (last rating was based off delivery). 10/10 aesthetics, huge space, also a store for locally sourced goods (candles, jams, wines, etc). Great place to find gifts. Got the inlet sandwich w/ prosciutto (extra), mozz, tomato, basil, balsamic vinaigrette, and basil mayo on ciabatta. Another hit, excellent flavors, super fresh ingredients, no complaints. They have a huge selection of unique beverages as well, sold individually. I got a canned matcha latte with oat milk, v good. Check it out fr","2022-06-21 01:51:15.772771+00:00"
"The Guava Limb Café","False","True","5","Hands down one of the best restaurants I’ve ever been to in my life! Amazing food, drinks, vibes, and waitstaff. If you’re ever in San Ignacio, Belize - you HAVE to go here. They had a 2 for 1 sangria special, so good. We got the white wine sangria and it had watermelon and pineapple in it. Started off with Thai shrimp summer rolls that came w guava sauce and peanut sauce (try them together, thank me later). I ordered the gado gado with chicken satay (an Indonesia specialty dish) and bf got the chili garlic shrimp fettuccine with garlic bread. Literally everything was so incredible and so beautifully presented. Could not have more positive to say about this spot. Also it’s indoor/outdoor seating so you get to see the beautiful wild birds of Belize flying and stopping at trees nearby your table. 100000/10!!!","2022-05-19 00:32:42.344956+00:00"
"Mango Mangeaux","False","True","5","2nd time visiting this place. Delish food & drinks (both alcoholic and virgin). Excellent, friendly service. They’re a restaurant created around their trademark “mango mango” preserves that they actually pitched on Shark Tank and grew their brand. Their cuisine is a mix of French/creole/neosoul. I’ve been here for brunch twice but they also do lunch and dinner! I got their chicken fried chicken French toast that comes w mango butter and an Avery panache drink (iced tea and lemonade with mango preserves). 10/10 recommend!","2022-07-24 16:08:42.853590+00:00"
"Plaza Azteca","False","True","4","Great food and great prices for lunch specials (<$12 all items). I got the burrito espinaca and it was delish, super flavorful and very green lol. Huge restaurant and fun decor. Great margs too I got a frozen mango marg. Minus 1 star because I asked to add mushrooms to my burrito and they forgot to and our waiter gave us a card for his car detailing side business when he brought us the check lol. ","2022-06-02 02:25:49.852031+00:00"
"Viking Burger","False","True","3","Went here with a friend and got the “Viking burger” with fries. Basically just a regular cheeseburger with their special Viking sauce which was pretty much just beef chili lol. Interesting concept but extremely average flavor imo. My friends who eat spicy food love this place for their “angry Odin” burger - cheeseburger made with ghost pepper cheese, jalapeños, onion rings, and Viking sauce. So if you’re into that, check it out. They also have chicken and veggie options. ","2022-06-15 20:45:09.365532+00:00"
"Bardea Food & Drink","False","True","5","Needs reservations! Went here for Valentine’s dinner and could not have picked a better spot for the occasion. Immaculate vibes, upscale cocktails, small share plate dining. Every single thing we ordered was delicious and beautiful - pics attached. Jumbo gnocchi (the only gnocchi I’ve ever liked in my life), Margherita pizza, calamari, tiramisu w 24k gold foil, raspberry cream cheese monkey bread, espresso martini (2 vday special cocktails not pictured but one was a mezcal drink that was on fire!!). Also note: this place has won a James Beard award.","2022-05-31 21:08:07.230071+00:00"
"Pop's Belize Restaurant","False","True","5","Another solid find in San Ignacio. All day breakfast menu at Pop’s, recommended to us by our cave guide. The classic Belizean breakfast is Chaya (basically a collard green/spinach-like veggie) & cheese scrambled eggs with fry jacks (literally mini Indian batura’s lol). I asked for my iced coffee extra sweet and they added a huge dollop of sweet cream and chocolate syrup so basically got an iced mocha haha. Another spot with friendly waitstaff and yummy food!

"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse","False","True","4","I’ve been here many, many times over the past year. Today was probs the best visit I’ve had hence the 4 stars bc otherwise I’d say 3 stars. Best items: seared ahi tuna salad, burgers, avocado rolls, tacos, pizookies, cocktails. Usual issues include: missing ingredients, major delays on pizookies for the specials.

"Sisters Thai The Ordinary Café (at MOSAIC)","False","True","5","My fav Thai place in nova, helps that it’s 5mins away from my parents home too 🙃 But lunch special is 10/10, my go-to is pad thai & thai iced tea. Super delish ","2022-09-05 23:23:21.611624+00:00"
"Nicecream","False","True","5","Great ice cream spot in Arlington. They have a rotating menu of 6 flavors (not sure how often they change it out) and they use liquid nitrogen to prepare the ice cream (hence Nicecream). I got the brownie sundae with coconut chocolate chunk ice cream and it was so delish! Huge serving (as pictured) and a big brownie that they heat up to order. Note: I did want the cookie sundae but they were out of fresh baked cookies for the day so don’t go in the evening if you wanna try this! Also serve specialty coffees and hot chocolates but didn’t get a change to try them out - interesting flavors like lavender hot cocoa though!! They seem like a poppin’ spot, had a steady stream of customers coming from 7-10:30pm. Solid shop for a lil friend hangout, visited this spot with @sanjana @vamsi @srikanth and Caitlyn ","2022-05-26 03:39:40.188055+00:00"
"Brown Chicken Brown Cow","False","True","4","Solid spot, came for brunch that they only serve Sunday mornings. They’re a really well known burger spot though so gonna have to come back for lunch/dinner sometime. I’d come back for the chicken & waffles alone - the honey butter spread was 🤤 and seasoning on the chicken was A+ lil bit of heat and sweet. Overall laidback spot, good for groups, average pricing.

"Ortega’s Street Tacos","False","True","4","Visited their pop-up at Oozlefinch brewery. Honestly 5 stars for flavor, one of the best chicken quesadillas I’ve had. Knocked a star bc it’s a small portion for $14 lol, everyone was still hungry after eating but didn’t wanna drop more money. But truly 10/10 flavor, they use a red sauce (dried pepper, not spicy) and green sauce (avocado crema) inside every quesadilla. They also do tacos!  ","2022-06-25 12:41:25.674273+00:00"
"The Deadrise","False","True","5","Solid spot for seafood lovers, right near the water. Indoor/outdoor seating, all the waitstaff are super friendly! Been here 3x now, best items: shrimp poboy, salmon blt, crab cake sandwich, and the seafood nachos. They have some higher end items too that are $$ for market price fish/crab and menu specials that change every time I’ve been there. ","2022-07-09 12:19:32.743724+00:00"
"Kiin Imm Thai Vienna","False","True","3","Only ordered takeout from here, never dined in. Honestly just wasn’t great food, flavors were subpar and spice levels are all over the place so watch what you ask for. Lots of better Thai options nearby. Fam ordered pad thai, drunken noodles, and panang curry - none of us loved our food. No idea if dine-in experience would be much better hence 3 stars.","2022-05-23 23:12:39.330355+00:00"
"Amor y Cafe","False","True","4","Excellent iced coffee - they use espresso ice cubes so it never gets watered down! Huevos rancheros were meh, not super flavorful, could use more seasoning. Good throwback American music! ","2022-05-17 23:32:01.047616+00:00"
"Bansari Indian Cuisine","False","True","5","My parents are literally obsessed with this place, we’ve ordered takeout at least 2-3x when I’ve been home and they’ve dined in too. It’s their go-to Indian food spot now lol. I’ve had multiple chicken and veg dishes from them and they were all solid. Check ‘em out","2022-05-23 23:15:53.537611+00:00"
