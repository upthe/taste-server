"Pil Pil","False","True","3","Good brunch vibes but the food isn’t that good. Bottomless drinks is $23 and service is good but the food being bad is a deal breaker. Also in UES so it’s a hike ","2022-04-23 17:51:16.808956+00:00"

"Tamarind Tribeca","False","True","4","Food was solid, palak Chaak was very salty but apparently that’s not normally how it is

Kofta was really good","2022-03-24 23:57:42.061836+00:00"
"ROOH","False","True","4","Food was really good, recommend the butter chicken, dal makhani, and lamb pepper fry. Drinks were also solid, the rasam Mary was great!

Ambiance was really nice and there only really brown people in the restaurant which is always a good sign.","2022-04-21 15:52:22.771049+00:00"
