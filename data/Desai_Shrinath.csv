"HipCityVeg","False","True","3","HipCityVeg was recommended to me as one of the best fake meat spots in the DMV! As a vegetarian, I can affirm that HipCityVeg does not disappoint. I tried their fake chicken (chick'n) on two styles of burgers - one traditional Buffalo chicken and the second a Mediterranean. All the ingredients pair together extremely well to create a unique experience with every bite. I recommend trying the Bistro Bella sub chick'n! Although a little pricey, overall @supershrinath approved!","2022-05-11 05:48:15.705989+00:00"
"Chuy's","False","True","5","Chuy’s is definitely one of my go-to tex-mex spots, however I’ve heard that it hits different in Texas. So I was super excited to try it in Dallas! Plus one of my friends always raved about his Chuy’s ritual, which he dubbed as the “Chuy’s Parth Patel Experience.” 

Before starting your meal, Parth always orders the complimentary fresh tortillas with a bowl of salsa, ranchero, and boom boom per person. You then take your hot tortilla, spread each of the sauces in layers, and finally top it off with crush tortilla chips. I kid you not, it tastes absolutely AMAZING! 

I ordered the veggie enchiladas smothered in boom boom sauce. It’s spinach, onions, zucchini, red bell peppers, serranos, roasted green chiles, corn, and cheese all wrapped in a flour or corn tortilla with a side of beans and rice. The enchiladas always taste super fresh and are filling. But it’s the boom boom sauce that steals the show. It pairs well with all the flavors of the seasoned veggies and never disappoints. 

Chuy’s is also one of my favorite spots because of their assortment of sauces. Although I like the boom boom the best, I highly recommend trying them all out to find your favorite. I also order the ranchero on the side anyways! 

The tomatillo sauce is tangy but mild and made from fresh green tomatillos, green onions, cilantro, and garlic. The deluxe tomatillo adds in sour cream, herbs, and spices for a creamier finish. The ranchero made with fire-roasted tomatoes, caramelized onions, bell peppers, cilantro, spices giving it a zesty flavor. The fan favorite boom boom is made from roasted New Mexican chiles, tomatillos, green onions, cilantro, and melted cheese. I always wanted try to the green chile and hatch green chile but unfortunately they aren’t vegetarian. 

Overall this Chuy’s has a great ambiance, had unlimited chips and salsa, and restaurant was HUGE! Pro-tip: if you order two half portions of a dish, you get double the sides! ","2022-05-18 20:45:54.276839+00:00"
"matchbox","False","True","4","Matchbox in Pentagon City was just like it's counterparts but with more elegant seating and a nicer ambiance. The restaurant is perfect for a date or a big celebration with friends and family.

All their pies are super light yet crispy. Each is packed with flavor and I highly recommend trying any one of their specialty pies.

I ordered the Fire + Smoke with a side of ranch. The Fire + Smoke was absolutely amazing with chipotle purée, roasted garlic, onions, red peppers, smoked gouda, basil, and a zesty tomato sauce. The pie was cooked till well done with a light char. The food is on the pricier side, ESPECIALLY for pizza. 

Pro tip: if you’re not into smoky flavors but love spice, they’ll make the Fire + Smoke without the chipotle/smoky ingredients but maintain the fire! ","2022-05-10 18:23:57.836846+00:00"
"Andy's Pizza","False","True","4","Lots of cities are known for great pizza, but unfortunately DC isn’t one of them. Which is why I was so excited to finally try Andy’s Pizza in Tysons II. I’d heard GREAT reviews about Andy’s pizza and was told that it’s a DC-Area must have. Let me tell you, Andy’s did not disappoint! 

We ordered four different slices (classic cheese, margherita, white with a side of mikes hot honey, and mushroom & onion) and Old Bay Fries. Every slice was light yet full of toppings and cheeses. The crust was baked to well done with a light char, resembling real NY style pizza! 

As the winner of the 2021 World Pizza Championship, you know I had to try the classic cheese first. It was definitely the best NY style slice I’ve had in DC and it made my top five of all time in that category. For me it was the sauce that truly stole the show and elevated my experience. Andy’s red sauce is some of the best I’ve had in a very long time. 

The margherita was solid but again just very similar to the cheese. However I did like the added basil and parmigiano flavors. The white slice, made with roasted garlic olive oil, mozzarella, provolone, and ricotta soprafina, was honestly okay but tasted much better with a drizzle of Mike’s Hot Honey. I’ve been trying to get into hot honey, so this was definitely a good introductory experience. Finally the mushroom & onion slice was made with roasted garlic olive oil, mozzarella, provolone, roasted cremini mushrooms, and caramelized onions. It was great but unmatched relative to its marinara sauce counterparts. 

I was also pleasantly surprised to fall in love with their Old Bay Fries. The fries were cooked and seasoned with Old Bay, making for a super savory and zesty experience. They were also fresh and crunchy, making it the perfect fry! 

Overall, I loved Andy’s. I’m excited to go back and try their Sicilian pies! ","2022-05-19 03:01:50.605781+00:00"
"Ristorante Margherita","False","True","4","Margherita Ristorante Pizzeria is a solid pizza and Italian spot in Barcelona, Spain! 

Their menu is super diverse, including options for individuals on any diet. We ordered the potato gnocchi and pizza capricciosa. 

The potato gnocchi was cooked in an homemade Genovese pesto with basil, parmesan, pine nuts, and garlic. The gnocchi was soft and packed with pesto flavor!

The pizza capricciosa had a tomato sauce base and was topped with mozzarella, mushrooms, artichokes, peppers, and black olives. I took off the ham since I’m vegetarian! Overall the pie was cooked well done to a char and was a great Italian neapolitan style slice. ","2022-05-11 19:49:16.983479+00:00"
"Soul Taco","False","True","3","I'd seen some amazing reviews, so decided to try out Soul Taco! The cute little shop is tucked away in the streets of Richmond and carries a small but cozy atmosphere.

We tried three dishes: flaming hot cheeto elote loco, sweet potato & black eyed peas taco, and the Buffalo cauliflower taco.

The elote loco was pretty much a roasted corn on the cob, topped with a spicy aioli, cotija cheese and then rolled in flaming hot cheeto dust and cilantro. In looked AMAZING, but didn't live up the hype. Definitely worth a one-time try though.

The tacos were both okay as well. I liked the Buffalo cauliflower taco over the sweet potato & black eyed pease, but neither were groundbreaking.","2022-05-11 05:23:48.102359+00:00"
"Carmello's Restaurant & Wine Bar","False","True","3","A little hard to find, but Carmello's is a solid Italian spot in Charlottesville, VA. Honestly my favorite part of the meal was their bread and seasoned butter - it was so fresh and warm and just melted in my mouth. As a vegetarian, I ordered ravioli with spinach and cheese. It was good but nothing special. I do recommend this Carmello's at least once simply for their bread and butter!","2022-05-11 05:21:39.396746+00:00"
"The Virginian","False","True","4","The Virginian is a Charlottesville and UVA classic! As a wahoo, my roommate and I frequented the Virg all the time.

My all time favorite dishes were their Famous Spinach & Artichoke Dip and Stumble Down Mac N' Cheese. Both dishes were fresh and packed with amazing flavors. The meal also went well with a side of their crispy fries. The Famous Spinach & Artichoke Dip is rich and creamy and is perfectly coupled with their house made tortilla chips. My favorite part of the Stumble Down Mac N' Cheese is the jalapeños pepper Jack cheese sauce and the potato pie laid on top of the mac. All together it's a filling and delicious meal!

Pro tip: if you're looking for a quick for filling snack, get the appetizer sized Stumble Down Mac N' Cheese!

I highly recommend the Virg in general to anyone visiting UVA or doing a Charlottesville food tour.","2022-05-11 05:46:56.239974+00:00"
"Christian's Pizza","False","True","5","Christian's Pizza will always be my favorite and go-to late night pizza spot at UVA and in Charlottesville. Their slices are baked fresh upon arrival and taste so good. They also have loads of unique toppings and pies to choose from!

My favorite slice at Christian's will forever be their Avocado Feta Pizza (AvoFeta). A couple other favorites are the Margherita, Pesto Tortellini, Classic Cheese, Mushroom on White!","2022-05-11 05:19:32.664877+00:00"
"The Pie Chest","False","True","5","The Pie Chest is a gem hidden away in the Charlottesville Downtown Mall. All of their sweet pies are TO DIE FOR. Each have their own perfect flavors and are enveloped in the most delicious and light crust. Each day is also filled with new flavors so there is always a new treat to try.

P.S. The Pecan Pie is one of my all time favorites!","2022-05-11 05:25:24.807307+00:00"
"Prince Street Pizza","False","True","5","Prince Street Pizza is easily the best pizza I've ever had in my life - no wonder so many celebrities have made their way to this hidden New York gem! Price Street's square slices are to die for!

The sauce is fresh and full of all the perfect flavors that complement the stringy cheese underneath. Together they create such a soft, warm, and deep layer that's cradled by the fluffy but firm crust. Coupled with the crunchy crust, each bite really becomes what a slice of pizza should aim to be!","2022-05-11 05:32:06.297297+00:00"
"MooThru","False","True","5","MooThru is some of the BEST ice cream I've ever had. All of their ice cream flavors are unique and packed with fresh tasting flavors. The ice cream itself is one of the creamiest ice creams I've had, where you can taste milk mixing with the mixed in flavors.

I highly recommend getting your scoop on one of their freshly made waffle cones! Every flavor tastes amazing both as a scoop and a milkshake.

Their flavors are also to die for! Some of my favorites include: Blackberry, Gingerbread Cookie, Mounds, Cookie Dough, Pumpkin Spice, Cookies N Cream!

The line is ALWAYS long (in-person & drive-thru), but it is 100% worth the wait!","2022-05-11 05:39:27.860851+00:00"
"Wiseguy Pizza","False","True","4","Wiseguy Pizza is an awesome pizza spot in Northern Virginia. They have some super dope specialty pies that always hit the spot and never fail to satisfy. Each slice is crispy yet light and has the perfect ratio of cheese to topping to sauce. They're also always cooked to well done!   

So far I've tried the Paneer Tikka, Margherita, Mushroom Truffle, and Grandma Square.  

As a huge fan of Indian fusion pizza, Wiseguy definitely has some of the best Paneer Tikka slices. It's a jalapeño sauce with house masala, paneer, mozzarella, onion, tomatoes, green peppers, chili peppers, and cilantro. The base sauce is nice and spicy which really helps bring out all the masala flavors. Each of the toppings fit right into each other. But my favorite part of the experience has to be jalapeño sauce drizzle! It's spice and savor sets it apart from any other paneer slice I've had!   

The Mushroom Truffle has a white sauce base with mushrooms, basil, goat cheese, mozzarella, parmigiano, and truffle oil. This pie is super creamy and packed with mushroomy flavor creating its own unique experience.  

The Margherita is pretty standard. Made up of tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil, parmigiano, and extra virgin olive oil, it always satisfied whenever looking for a simple but classic slice. However the Grandma Square does the same taste wise, but is on whole new level with texture and experience. It's a square slice cooked well done with marinara, mozzarella, basil, and extra virgin olive oil.","2022-05-16 22:04:17.852252+00:00"
"The Village Cafe","False","True","3","The Village Cafe is a great brunch spot in Richmond, VA. Any VCU student will tell you that this their go to for a lazy Saturday or Sunday morning.

In my experience, their food was solid and did the job! The staff was super nice and quick and really added to the experience. The Village does get packed though, so make sure to get there early!","2022-05-11 05:16:55.543985+00:00"
"Dolcezza","False","True","4","Dolcezza's gelato was some of the best gelato I've had in the NOVA/DC area! All the flavors were rich and diverse. Each had their own remarkable taste. I highly recommend ending your night at Dolcezza if you're in Fairfax's Mosaic District.","2022-05-11 05:41:43.433266+00:00"
"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse","False","True","4","BJ's was my favorite place to be on Tuesday nights because of their half off pizookies! Consistently amazing, the mini-pizookie is definitely big enough to feed two people and 100% worth the price point on Tuesdays!

I recommend the triple chocolate, monkey bread, salted caramel, cookies n cream, and chocolate chunk!","2022-05-11 05:27:12.807687+00:00"
"La Flor Michoacana Mexican Ice Cream Shop","False","True","5","My friends and I used to frequent La Flor Michoacana all the time during our summers in Charlottesville. Their popsicles are truly AMAZING. They have a HUGE variety of flavors and each with their own aesthetic look and taste. La Flor Michoacana will always be one of my favorite spots to stop by at in Charlottesville.","2022-05-11 05:19:53.225791+00:00"
"Dimple's Bombaytalk","False","True","3","Dimple's Bombay Talk can be found in the Indian food capital of the east coast: Oak Tree Rd in Edison, NJ. They have a wide variety of dishes, all tuned to their own specific flavors.

We decided to try some of their bites (chaat style dishes), which they are known the most for. We ordered the samosa chat and khasta kachori. Both were good and packed with flavor, however there was no ""wow"" factor. It felt as if the same foods could be made at home. However, I do look forward to trying more of their dishes at my next visit!","2022-05-11 05:12:02.840103+00:00"
"Red Robin","False","True","3","Red Robin is one of my favorite burger chains. However the Charlottesville location isn't as good as others I've been to in Northern Virginia. It's greasy and heavy, just a like burger and fries should be!

My favorite dish of the menu is the Burnin' Love with onion straws and a side of garlic fries. When dining in, you have to go bottomless with the fries.

Red Robin also has some AMAZING sauces to choose from with their campfire sauce, poppyseed-honey mustard, and brand new buzz sauce being my favorites!

P.S. if you join Red Robin Rewards, you get a FREE birthday burger every year!","2022-05-11 05:13:25.402482+00:00"
"Charm School- Social club","False","True","5","Charm School is one of the best Ice Cream places in Richmond, and honestly Virginia! Every flavor is super creamy and unique. They're menu is always innovating, so there's always something new to try at every visit. The ambiance and aesthetic of the store is also so cute, it makes for the perfect photo op (especially the famous Richmond Charm School mural outside the store).

We got the lavender and peach crisp, and both were AMAZING! Highly recommend trying these two fruity and often hard to find flavors!","2022-05-11 05:24:06.360083+00:00"
"Slice Joint","False","True","3","I was super excited to try the Slice Joint at the Roost, it didn't disappoint! I'm a huge fan of square slices so was excited to try the square cheese.

Overall the pizza was solid with a crunchy crust coupled with a thick but airy bread foundation. The sauce and cheese were also packed with flavor, just a bit saltier than I would've liked. Other than that, I can complain! I'm excited to visit again and try an New York style slice!

You have to order via the Roost ordering service which was a little confusing to figure out, but their is staff around the entire food hall to help! But pretty much, you find any open seat and scan the QR code associated with that seat. From there you can order and pay for all your food right from the site. There is both indoor and outdoor seating!","2022-05-11 05:30:37.987700+00:00"
"Burro Cheese kitchen","False","True","4","Burro’s grilled cheeses had been hyped up for a long time, so I was super excited to visit the food truck on Rainey Street! 

I got the waylon & willie which was aged cheddar, Gouda, caramelized onions and pepperoncinis all grilled between two pieces of sourdough bread. The sandwich was pretty solid. It was grilled to a perfect crisp and the onions and pepperoncinis complemented the gooey cheese. However my favorite part of the meal was dipping the grilled cheese into the habanero yellowbird sauce. The sauce was super spicy but still retained lots of flavors and really added to the salty/savory feel of these. 

It wasn’t the best sandwich or grilled cheese I’ve had, but it’s definitely up there. Overall the food truck had a dope vibe and long lines (def worth the wait)! ","2022-07-08 15:29:39.153115+00:00"
"Tijuana Flats","False","True","4","Having had it originally in Florida, Tijuana Flats has become a must visit whenever I'm in Virginia Beach! All of their appetizers, dips, entrees, and desserts are absolutely fresh and amazing. But my favorite part of the dining experience is the hot sauce bar! 

My favorite items are the nachos, veggie burrito, and mexican pizza. Other staples include the Tijuana Trio (guac, salsa, and queso), the dos tacos, and their infamous flautas. All of their dishes are packed with flavor, large, and easily customizable. As a vegetarian, I was able to the to try almost every dish without any worries. 

If you try the flautas or burrito, make sure you get it ""wet."" For a little bit extra, you can smother it in their red sauce, queso, or verde sauce. Trust me, it's 100% worth it! Also in general, make sure your dish either had a queso or get a side of it because it pairs super well with all their food. 

Their chips are also seasoned giving them a nice kick (they come with most dishes). I highly recommend trying out the hot sauces and even buying some bottles for home! My favorite is easily the ""Smack My Ass and Call Me Sally."" 

If you have a sweet tooth, all their desserts also look delicious,. My go to has always been their cookie dough flautas. It's literally deep fried cookie dough with powdered sugar and chocolate sauce. 

Tijuana consistently delivers and this location isn't any different 😋","2022-05-10 17:47:06.484565+00:00"
"Tony's NY Pizza","False","True","3","Tony's NY Pizza in Fairfax has always been an okay staple. Their pizza is big, filling, and has lots of modifiable options. However the sauces lack some taste and since most pies are pre-made, they lack a level of freshness. However their lunch special of a slice, fries, and a drink for $7 is unbeatable!

We ordered an artichoke slice and an eggplant parmesan slice. The artichoke pie was on white sauce with four cheese, basil, garlic, artichoke, mushroom, and tomatoes. Presentation was a 10/10, but overall it was okay and even a little cold. The eggplant parm slice literally had eggplant parmesan embedded between the marinara sauce and mozzarella. This one was MUCH better but again, definitely have had better.

Given how close by and cheap it is, I would definitely return for a slice with marinara.","2022-05-10 16:21:42.100023+00:00"
"First Watch","False","True","5","First Watch is one of my favorite vegetarian friendly brunch spots in Charlottesville, VA. Being a chain, I was a little skeptical at first but First Watch delivers every single time. All of their dishes are packed with flavor and loads of fresh and healthy ingredients creating the perfect balanced meal. They also have so much variety that you can try a different dish on the menu each time until you find your favorite.

My favorite dishes to date are the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes (seasonal) and the Market Veggie sandwich.

The Lemon Ricotta Pancakes are seasonal, so check online or call in before hand if you want to try them! They're some of the fluffiest pancakes I've had and pair so well with the lemon ricotta cream and strawberries. The dish holds the perfect amount of sweetness and is super filling.

The Market Veggie Sandwich also always satisfies. It's made up of house-roasted crimini mushrooms, zucchini, spinach, pesto, mayo, and mozzarella cheese on grilled artisan whole grain. The sandwich is light yet filling and pairs super well with their basil backed tomato soup!

If you're an egg person and are looking for a sandwich alternative, I recommend trying out the The Elevated Egg Sandwich. It's made up of over-easy eggs, gruyere cheese, smashed avocado, mayo, and lemon-dressed arugula on a brioche bun. The sandwich is egg-tastic but not as filling as other options. It does come with a side of First Watch's house seasoned potatoes though. I have yet to try The Elevated Egg Sandwich at the Charlottesville location, so I'm excited to do that soon!

Highly recommend First Watch to anyone looking for a solid brunch spot on a mid-range budget.","2022-05-11 05:23:03.994688+00:00"
"Deep Ellum Tacos El Habanero","False","True","4","Deep Ellum Tacos was a quick and inexpensive spot for Mexican food in Dallas, TX. It’s a hole in the wall, to-go only spot but they do have some tables set up on the street up front. 

We ordered the street style taco, gordita, nachos de la casa, and handmade quesadilla all with veggies. 

The taco was made with mushrooms, fajita veggies, white onion, cilantro, and lime grilled on a corn tortilla. It was solid but nothing super special. It was served with a habanero sauce which definitely enhanced the experience. 

The gordita was a fried masa stuffed with mushrooms, fajita veggies, lettuce, beans, cotija cheese, Mexican cream, and guacamole. The gordita was absolutely amazing. It was crunchy and filled with the perfect amount of food. I just wish the fried masa had been a little less oily. 

The nachos were made from homemade tortilla chips, cheese, veggies, guacamole, beans, cream, jalapeños, and the habanero sauce. The nachos weee easily my favorite item of the menu. 

Finally the quesadilla was a deep fried tortilla stuffed with Mexican mashed potatoes, lettuce, cream, and cheese. It was solid but again nothing amazing.

Overall Deep Ellum Tacos had some great food for a great price. I’d recommend the nachos and gordita both for their tastes as well as portions. I’d definitely stop by when visiting Dallas in the future! ","2022-05-18 22:59:03.405786+00:00"
"Rupa Vira's The Signature","False","True","4","After countless recommendations and reviews, I was excited to finally try Rupa Vira's The Signature. Although I've tried a lot of their menu at local weddings, this was my first time visiting the restaurant.  

We ordered the mix pakora and gobi manchurian as appetizers. The portions for both were huge! The mix pakora was average. The veggies were seasoned and cooked well, but there was just a lot of fried batter. The gobi manchurian was absolutely phenomenal. Each bite was super crispy and the sauce was to die for.

For the main course we ordered the paneer butter masala and malai kofta with garlic naan. Both were solid but there was nothing special; pretty similar to those of other restaurants. The portions for the two entrees was also smaller than expected.  For drinks, we ordered the mango lassi. Although it was yummy, it was too small for the price listed.

In regards to food, it seems like Rupa Vira's The Signature kills the appetizers and chat style foods. I plan to come back again and again to eat through the entire app/chat menu!","2022-05-10 22:18:30.406238+00:00"

"Blaze Pizza","False","True","4","Blaze Pizza at Disney Springs us phenomenal! It's hard to go wrong with a make your own pizza place, but Blaze goes above and beyond. You'll be able to quench your pizza cravings with an 11 inch personal pizza that doesn't break the bank. Seated in the heart of Disney Springs, the ambiance of the indoor and outdoor seating is amazing.  

The best thing about Blaze is that you can get unlimited sauces, toppings, and cheeses. So I use Blaze as my one excuse to really pile the flavors up. And at the end when picking up your pizza, don't forget to get all the different finishes (both drizzled and on the side)! My favorites are Buffalo sauce, ranch, and srirancha!  

Blaze's portions are also solid. Given how hungry you are, you'll either fill up perfectly or can even share a pie between two!   

Hack: If you like pesto, ask for a spicy red sauce base (extra sauce of course) with pesto around the crust!","2022-05-11 04:07:26.003698+00:00"
"Chuy's","False","True","5","Chuy's is definitely one of my go-to tex-mex spots. They have a pretty big menu and are always accommodating with substitutions, so it's perfect for vegetarians and satisfies every time.  

I normally get the veggie enchiladas smothered in boom boom sauce. It's spinach, onions, zucchini, red bell peppers, serranos, roasted green chiles, corn, and cheese all wrapped in a flour or corn tortilla with a side of beans and rice. The enchiladas always taste super fresh and are filling. But it's the boom boom sauce that steals the show. It pairs well with all the flavors of the seasoned veggies and never disappoints.   

Chuy's is also one of my favorite spots because of their assortment of sauces. Although I like the boom boom the best, I highly recommend trying them all out to find your favorite. I also order the ranchero on the side anyways!   

The tomatillo sauce is tangy but mild and made from fresh green tomatillos, green onions, cilantro, and garlic. The deluxe tomatillo adds in sour cream, herbs, and spices for a creamier finish. The ranchero made with fire-roasted tomatoes, caramelized onions, bell peppers, cilantro, spices giving it a zesty flavor. The fan favorite boom boom is made from roasted New Mexican chiles, tomatillos, green onions, cilantro, and melted cheese. I always wanted try to the green chile and hatch green chile but unfortunately they aren't vegetarian.   

Overall this Chuy's (my og 😤) has a great staff, offers unlimited chips and salsa (always a plus 😂) ,and the dishes are usually big enough to split! Pro-tip: if you order two half portions of a dish, you get double the sides!","2022-05-18 23:45:01.405966+00:00"
"Restaurantes Zarabanda Sociedad Limitada","False","True","3","Zarabanda was an okay restaurant with unique foods and plating. They were able to accommodate large groups and vegetarians, which was definitely a plus however the food just wasn’t that great. 

We ordered the bird’s nest and a pizza with roasted red papers, white onion, caramelized onions, and mozzarella. The birds nest looked really cool and had a newfound texture but was bland (seemed like the only seasoning was salt). The pizza was mid, nothing special. ","2022-05-16 21:48:44.498049+00:00"
"The Board Room Game Bar & Brewery","False","True","5","The Board Room is a dope spot to hang with friends. The game room and bar vibe really meshes well together and seems to be super popular in the Arlington area. 

You can grab a table or make a reservation and that’s it! All the games are displayed for public use, and there’s lots of staff to hand orders of food and drinks. 

During @robel’s birthday, I got to try their pretzel and nachos. The pretzel was super soft, salted well, paired great with their melted cheese sauces. The nachos were also a hit! We were able to make them with salsa, guacamole, cheese, beans, and sour cream. Although simple, it definitely hit the spot. The food portions in general were larger than I expected. 

After multiple visits, I can definitely attest that the service is phenomenal. The drinks were solid, but nothing special. ","2022-06-22 15:48:23.659950+00:00"

I ordered the quesadillas to try something new. Although they were listed as an appetizer, they were pretty big and honestly super filling. It's a flour tortilla stuffed with cheese, green chilies, and onions. It's served with a side of guacamole, sour cream, and tomatoes. Rather than one big quesadilla, they serve you four smaller ones that will definitely quench your appetite. The cheese pairs well with seasoned veggies makes for the perfect bite when dipped in some boom boom sauce.

Chuy's is also one of my favorite spots because of their assortment of sauces. Although I like the boom boom the best, I highly recommend trying them all out to find your favorite. I also order the ranchero on the side anyways!

"Ocha Thai Kitchen & Cafe","False","True","4","Ochoa Thai is a great Thai option in Northern Virginia! The restaurant aesthetic is super cute and gives off cozy vibes.

We ordered the drunken noodles and panang curry. Both portions were of a descent size especially when getting tofu and vegetables. Do note however, that there is an extra charge for getting both tofu AND vegetables. Many have noted that the dishes are rather plain and less filling when both aren't ordered!

The drunken noodles were cooked in a sauce balancing sweet and savory making them super delicious. We ordered medium spicy which wasn't very hot, so we did need a spice tray. Overall they had the classic drunken noodle taste and satisfied my Thai cravings.

The panang curry wasn't the best I've ever had, but still pretty solid. It was on the less sweet side, but still paired well with all the veggies, tofu, and rice.

Like at most Thai restaurants, my favorite pairing was soaking the drunken noodles inside the panang curry. The dish combination at Ocha Thai was amazing. I definitely recommend trying it out!

For beverages, we ordered the Thai Iced Tea! It tasted different than other Thai Iced Teas I've had before. It was hard to tell what the flavor was exactly, but it was very different.","2022-05-11 05:12:31.759088+00:00"
"Benny’s","False","True","3","Benny's is pretty solid and consistent, no matter which location you go to. Same is true for Benny Delucas in Charlottesville, VA. Slices are usually ready and it does take a bit to make the huge 28 inch pie, but nothing crazy.

It definitely isn't a top pizza place but trying a slice as big as your face is 100% worth it!","2022-05-11 05:20:17.794461+00:00"
"SWITCH POP UP BAR","False","True","3","SWITCH Pop-Up in Richmond, VA is a cool concept theme bar. They have two levels, each with their own theme that SWITCHES up every couple of months. 

The decor and theme integration are absolutely amazing. Switch has thought through every detail and every inch of the building makes you feel like you’re in a different world. 

When I visited in May 2022, the ground floor was Willy Wonka themed and the basement was Super Mario (unfortunately the basement was closed when we visited). The drinks and food were alright but definitely recommend a quick visit for the visual experience! ","2022-05-23 01:15:53.192824+00:00"
"Sanissimo Gran Vía","False","True","5","Sanissimo (Gran Vía) was an amazing all vegan restaurant in Madrid. Their menu has TONS of options and can be modified to your liking. Sanissimo strives to deliver healthy but tasty food options while respecting the environment! 

We ordered a large assortment of dishes but the three I remember the most were the Spartan Burger, Pioneer Wrap, and Vegetarian Lasagna!

The Spartan was centered around an artisan vegetable meat patty made of pumpkin, eggplant, onion, and mushrooms. It was then assembled with zucchini, green olive, vegan cheese, lamb's lettuce, sweet mustard, veganesse, and gluten-free bread. We also got one variation where we substituted the patty with fake chicken. Overall I loved trying the Spartan, it was extremely fresh and delivered an amazing combination of flavors.  

The next best item was the Pioneer wrap which was made with spinach hummus, quinoa, mushrooms, lettuce, tzatziki, and veganesse. Overall the Pioneer was fresh and light but was packed with flavor. 

Finally the vegetarian lasagna had no cheese! This came as a surprise to one of my friends but was rather layers of vegetables all baked together. Although it was my least favorite of three items I tried, it was still a quality dish. 

Every dish is also served with a side of potatoes and sauce of your choice! ","2022-05-22 10:18:07.243209+00:00"
"Taco Bell","False","True","3","As an avid Taco Bell fan, I had to try it in España! Overall it was very different than in the US. The chips and tortilla were of different consistencies and tasted different as well. 

We ordered nachos and a burrito GSB. The nachos were chips topped with salsa, beans, sour cream, guacamole, and nacho cheese. The burrito GSB was honestly very similar to a 7-Layer/Veggie Fiesta burrito but had a different kick to it. 

Trying taco bell in Spain was definitely worth the one time experience but it’s nothing like the states. ","2022-05-11 20:01:49.930639+00:00"
"Ben & Jerry's","False","True","3","The Ben & Jerry’s at RTC was solid but nothing spectacular. I’ve been to enough Ben & Jerry’s locations to know that their ice cream gets the job done. I got the chocolate chip cookie dough, but it was kind of underwhelming. It tasted like vanilla ice cream with one or two tiny blouses of cookie dough. The staff was also in a rush and gave out small scoops regardless of the size. ","2022-05-15 02:14:16.990897+00:00"
"Chennai Express- Ashburn","False","True","5","Chennai Express in Ashburn is one of my favorite South Indian restaurants in all of Northern Virginia! The restaurant is filled with the aroma of fresh foods and delicious flavors.

I ordered the paneer masala dosa and vegetable biryani and was pleasantly surprised. Both dishes were packed with flavor and spice and made me want to come back for more. The dosa was firm but thin and filled with the most wonderful paneer filling.

Pro tip: Ask the waiter to bring you extra dosa filling (whichever type you get) on the side. It's free of cost, and that way you get more to eat your dosa with!","2022-05-11 05:25:55.882306+00:00"
"Vinito Ristorante","False","True","4","Vinito Ristorante in Orlando, FL is one of my favorite Italian restaurants of all time. All their food is so rich and authentic, it always has me wanting to go back for more. And their service is even more excellent than their food!   

We ordered the Caprese & Roasted Peppers and Bruschetta as appetizers. The caprese & roasted peppers was essentially a tower of fresh mozzarella cheese, vine ripe tomatoes, roasted bell peppers, and fresh basil topped with extra virgin olive oil. The cheese was so fresh and delicious, it paired perfectly with the fresh ripe tomatoes. The bruschetta was made of some do the most aromatic ciabatta bread grilled and topped with extra virgin olive oil, diced plum tomatoes, parmesan cheese, and basil. Although both dishes were simple, the chefs at Vinito were able to enhance all the flavors! 

For the entree, we ordered the Tortelloni Grattinati. It was essential tortellini with wild mushrooms and spring peas immersed in a cream sauce and barked with mozzarella cheese. The dish was super creamy and packed with savory mushroom flavor. It had a level of freshness and authenticity that's been hard to find at Italian restaurants in the US.","2022-05-11 04:05:43.437065+00:00"
"Schmackary's","False","True","3","If you're looking for a quick and easy dessert to quench your sweet tooth, Schmackary's is the perfect place. All their cookies are baked fresh and look absolutely amazing. I only got to try the one flavor but I hope to be back soon to try the rest!","2022-05-11 05:34:11.249165+00:00"
"Mi Casita Mexican Grill","False","True","2","I visited Mi Casita a couple years ago and it was honestly just okay. They give huge portions at great prices, which does help bump up the experience. They were also vegetarian friendly, being able to substitute any of the proteins for beans or extra veggies.

The food was not very memorable and was just classic Mexican food you find in the US.","2022-05-11 05:15:47.182712+00:00"
"Kolache Factory","False","True","3","I tried my first kolache recently at the Kolache Factory in Richardson, TX and it was honestly pretty good! Kolaches are a modern take on a classic eastern European pastry roll. The idea was founded as a way to serve high quality breakfast on the go. It's essentially baked dough that's then filled with sweet or savory ingredients (e.g. cheese, fruit, egg, potato, jams, cream cheese, etc.). 

They had loads of options to choose from but I ended up going with a potato, egg, and cheese. It was soft and savory and paired super well with Texas Pete hot sauce. My only complaint was that other than simple flavors, there weren't that many options for vegetarians. I wanted to try the jalapeño popper, pizza, enchilada, and ranchero flavors but they all had meat.","2022-05-17 14:59:44.415652+00:00"
"First Watch","False","True","5","First Watch is one of my favorite vegetarian friendly brunch spots in Northern Virginia. Being a chain, I was a little skeptical at first but First Watch delivers every single time. All of their dishes are packed with flavor and loads of fresh and healthy ingredients creating the perfect balanced meal. They also have so much variety that you can try a different dish on the menu each time until you find your favorite.

My favorite dishes to date are the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes (seasonal) and the Market Veggie sandwich.

The Lemon Ricotta Pancakes are seasonal, so check online or call in before hand if you want to try them! They're some of the fluffiest pancakes I've had and pair so well with the lemon ricotta cream and strawberries. The dish holds the perfect amount of sweetness and is super filling.

The Market Veggie Sandwich also always satisfies. It's made up of house-roasted crimini mushrooms, zucchini, spinach, pesto, mayo, and mozzarella cheese on grilled artisan whole grain. The sandwich is light yet filling and pairs super well with their basil backed tomato soup!

If you're an egg person and are looking for a sandwich alternative, I recommend trying out the The Elevated Egg Sandwich. It's made up of over-easy eggs, gruyere cheese, smashed avocado, mayo, and lemon-dressed arugula on a brioche bun. The sandwich is egg-tastic but not as filling as other options. It does come with a side of First Watch's house seasoned potatoes though!

Highly recommend First Watch to anyone looking for a solid brunch spot on a mid-range budget.","2022-05-11 05:07:24.007280+00:00"
"Farm Bell Kitchen","False","True","2","The food at Farm Bell kitchen was extremely underwhelming. Farm Bell had been on my Charlottesville list for a long time but I had never gotten the opportunity to try it. So after four years, we visited on a Sunday for brunch and found that the menu was limited.

The staff was amazing and accommodating. The vibes of the restaurant are also unique and different (I highly recommend checking it out simply to dine in that ambiance). However I was not impressed by the food

I ordered the Banana Beignets, Fried Green Tomatoes, and the South by Southwest. All three dishes were different than foods I had tried before but I wanted to keep an open mind!

The Banana Beignets were made of golden crispy dough with bourbon and caramel sauce. They were cold when we got them and gave off a bitter taste. The fried green tomatoes came with house mozzarella, remoulade, and caperberries and again simply lacked flavor. Finally my main dish, the South by Southwest, was huevos rancheros with corn tortillas, sweet potatoes, black eyed peas, and avocado salsa. However again the dish lacked flavor and the portion size was tiny relative to high price.

Although the dining experience is unmatched, the food did not reflect in regards to taste, portions, and price!","2022-05-11 05:36:04.351796+00:00"
"Twistee Treat","False","True","3","Although not the best ice cream/soft serve I've ever had, Twistee Treat for sure quenches all your dessert cravings for a great price!","2022-05-11 05:44:29.671694+00:00"
"JINYA Ramen Bar","False","True","4","JINYA Ramen bar always quenches my ramen cravings. Their high end version of the simple dish will warm you up on any cold day. I highly recommend the Flying Vegan Harvest since it encompasses so many different flavors and ingredients while still focusing on the broth and noodles! As a vegetarian, JINYA is one of my favorite places to find vegetarian/vegan ramen. Although normally a 5, there was something different about the dish at RTC that brought it down to a 4.

P.S. Ask for their spicy ramen sauce to add in for a spicy kick!","2022-05-11 05:47:46.569059+00:00"
"SK Donuts","False","True","4","SK Donuts & Croissant always has their line going OUT THE DOOR! These donuts are some of the most creative and coolest donuts in all of LA! 

We ordered the Red Velvet Glazed, S'mores, Oreo Blast, Samoa, Dulce De Leche, Reese's PB Oreo, Fruity Pebbles, and Oreo Skronut! Getting this many for a group of five was definitely a lot but 100% worth it for the experience! 

Every donut was cake-y and fluffy which helped balance the dense toppings on each donut. Holistically, my favorites were the definitely the Druity Pebbles and Dulce de Leche. In regards to the donut itself, Red Velvet won by a landslide. And in terms of just the topping, I would go with Dulce De Leche or Oreo Blast!

My absolute favorite part of SK Donuts & Croissant was there skronut! This was the only part of their menu that was specific to them and they knocked it out of the park. Skronut stands for SK Croissant Donut! It was fluffy and buttery like a croissant but chewy and smothered with toppings like a donut. We for the Oreo Skronut and it's 100% a must get!","2022-05-09 19:30:09.630725+00:00"
"True Food Kitchen","False","True","5","True Food Kitchen in RTC was a super cool food experience. A couple friends and I wanted to try out their healthier and fresh menu especially since they had some dope vegetarian and vegan options.

We tried the edamame dumplings, double cheeseburger, Korean noodle bowl, and tomato and lemon ricotta flatbread. 

The dumplings were vegetarian and made with miso broth, white truffle oil, herbs, and edamame. The dumplings were cooked to a soft but chewy consistency and were packed with savory flavors. I was honestly skeptical about trying an edamame dish but absolutely loved it! It ended up being my favorite dish of the night. Note, it does have an Asian kick to it. 

The vegan double cheeseburger is made with a house vegan portobello, walnut, and beet patty. It’s then assembled with pickled onions, tomatoes, vegan cheddar (I recommend subbing or adding their gouda), veganaise/mayo, and a flaxseed bun. Overall, it was super filling and tasted amazing. All the flavors came together super well and was a hearty dining experience. 

The Korean noodle bowl was probably the most interesting dish. It was gluten free and vegan. It was assembled with sweet potato glass noodles (they actually looked so cool), pickled shiitake, spinach, carrots, bean sprouts, and toasted sesame. It was all cooked in a sauce that definitely had hints of Korean spices and flavors. Since it was my first time trying a Korean dish, it was different but I liked it a lot. The only thing I would ask for is more sauce! But like actually, the glass noodles themselves are worth the order. 

Finally the tomato and lemon ricotta flatbread was probably the most underwhelming of the four. Being vegan, it was cherry tomatoes, red onion, lemon ricotta, arugula, and cilantro pumpkin seed pesto spread on flatbread. My major complaint here was that the flatbread was super thin and not spongy at all. Other than that the flavors complimented each other well and the cilantro pumpkin seed pesto definitely stole the show! 

Overall True Food Kitchen was great! The RTC restaurant had dim light vibes and the staff was accommodating even though we visited near closing time. Pro tip: ask for their spicy sauce; it pairs well with all their dishes and adds the perfect kick. ","2022-05-16 22:20:52.526455+00:00"
"JINYA Ramen Bar","False","True","5","JINYA Ramen bar is my GO TO pick for ramen these days. Their high end version of the simple dish warms you up on any cold day and I can attest that it is ALWAYS consistent. I highly recommend the Flying Vegan Harvest since it encompasses so many different flavors and ingredients while still retaining the taste and feel of the broth and noodles! As a vegetarian, JINYA is one of my favorite places to find vegetarian/vegan ramen. The Fairfax/Mosaic location was easily a 5/5!

P.S. Ask for their spicy ramen sauce to add in for a spicy kick! It's 100% worth!

After trying both the Flying Vegan Harvest and Spicy Cream Vegan Ramen, I can attest that the Flying Vegan Harvest is definitely better. The toppings and flavors added into the broth come together better than in the alternative. And pro-tip for anyone not in love with fake meat or if trying for the first time, ask for the fake meat on the side instead of in your bowl!","2022-05-11 05:42:07.500698+00:00"
"Bodo's Bagels","False","True","5","Bodo's Bagels is one of my ALL TIME favorite bagel joints. Again biased with nostalgia, but Bodo's has objectively been my go to spot to quench my food cravings since 2015!

Bodo's makes fresh water bagels every single day, giving NYC & NJ bagels a serious run for their money. The soft and flavorful bagels taste consistently amazing and fresh upon every single visit. Everything from fermentation of the bagel itself to to the countless toppings, Bodo's always tastes amazing. Regardless of ordering a bagel sandwich or a classic bagel with cream cheese, Bodo's does not disappoint. The cream cheeses (CC) are also to die for! They have countless flavors and each are whipped to be extremely fluffy and light.

All of their fresh ingredients come together to create the most memorable experience wanting you to go back for more. Everything is also set at an excellent price point!

If you're ever in Charlottesville, VA, Bodo's Bagels is a MUST VISIT!

My favorites include: the everything bagel, jalapeño lime cream cheese (never have had anything like it before), and the pepper spread.

My go-to order which I and many of my peers have HIGHLY RECOMMENDED is: ""an everything bagel w jalapeño lime cream cheese, Swiss or provolone cheese, an egg, lettuce, tomato, onion, sprouts, and pepper spread on the side."" Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed!","2022-05-11 05:40:33.773067+00:00"
"Xàtiva Gràcia","False","True","4","L'Arrosseria Xàtiva in Barcelona was the perfect touristy and foodie experience. Through my research, I found that there aren’t many spots that made good and true to normal taste vegetarian paella. But L'Arrosseria Xàtiva had multiple options and they all tasted great! 

We ordered the cebolla caramelizada (caramelized onions) and verduras de la huerta (vegetables from the garden) paellas. Both were savory rice dishes full of flavor and veggies cooked well done to a slight crisp. The rice just tasted soooo good and paired super well with the creamy sauces and toppings. 

The portions were HUGE and it was even served in an authentic paellero in order to maintain the temperature of the paella and consistency of the rice. The staff was super accommodating and the chef even made sure that there would be no cross contamination with any meats or seafood. 

I highly recommend L'Arrosseria Xàtiva to anyone wanting to try paella when in Barcelona! And make sure to book a table on their website ahead of time. ","2022-05-16 02:18:54.171544+00:00"
"John's of Bleecker Street","False","True","3","John's of a Bleecker Street is one of the more famous pizza shops in NYC! Their classic cheese is solid but not on par with nearby competitors. Definitely worth checking out though!","2022-05-11 05:40:01.082901+00:00"
"Velvet Taco","False","True","5","Velvet Taco is one of my all time favorite taco spots in Texas! I’ve visited the one in Austin twice in the past year. They have a wide variety of flavors and everything can be easily modified to your liking. It's also probably the most ""different"" taco spot, making it a must visit.  

I've tried all four vegetarian adoptions: Nashville Hot Tofu, Fried Paneer, Falafel, and Beer Battered Cauliflower. I also tried the Spicy Tikka Chicken (with paneer instead) and the Korean Fried Rice (with tofu).

The Spicy Tikka Chicken with paneer is my all time favorite and go to! It’s crispy fried paneer with tikka sauce, buttered cilantro basmati rice, raita crema, and Thai basil all wrapped in a flour tortilla. The tikka sauce has a savory flavor that’s absolutely amazing. It pairs super well with the paneer and rice and is perfect every single time! 

The Beer Battered Cauliflower is my second favorite and is made up of queso blanco, Texas Pete sabor sauce, avocado corn pico, and dusted candied pepitas on a flour tortilla. This taco balances all the flavors and is absolutely AMAZING! It’s super creamy and just hits the spot. 

The Korean fried rice with tofu was a different but rewarding experience. It’s egg fried rice, tofu, red chile aioli, pickled red onion, jalapeños, grilled pineapple, and cilantro wrapped in a flour tortilla. I love Asian and island type cuisines, so this taco hit the spot with all the diverse flavors. 

The Nashville Hot Tofu is made up of crispy tofu, napa slaw, ranch crema, and house brined pickles on a flour tortilla. It's one of their best ones and highly recommend it to anyone trying to get a Nashville hot chicken vibe. If you eat meat, you can even get the tofu replaced! 

The fried paneer is crispy paneer, tomato chutney, tikka sauce, raita crema, and Thai basil all on a flour tortilla. This taco also always hits the spot and creates the perfect Indian-Mexican fusion experience.

Finally the Falafel is tahini crema, arugula, tomato, pickled fresnos, avocado, pickled red onion and pea tendrils on a lettuce wrap but you can ask for a tortilla! 

Pro tip: Make sure you try both sauces they have on the tables. Both truly enhance the experience. The lighter one is more sour and the darker one has a stronger kick. 

The queso was okay, but worth a one time try. But their red velvet cake was TO DIE FOR! Will definitely be getting that again! I’m also super excited to try vegetarian versions of all the other tacos. ","2022-07-08 16:08:49.292770+00:00"
"Adyar Ananda Bhavan","False","True","4","A2B - Adyar Ananda Bhavan is an awesome option for an amazing Indian and vegetarian meal. They have a wide variety to chose from, but I was told to try the South Indian dishes!   

We ordered the Paneer Masala Dosa, Paneer Chilli Fries, Rava Masala Dosa, and Kothu Parotta.   

The paneer masala dosa was okay. The dosa itself was pretty average with nothing too special. However the paneer filling was dense and fresh. I wish that they would have given more paneer and made it spicer. But the rava masala dosa was out of this world! Every bite was super savory and packed with amazing flavors. This dosa was definitely my favorite part of the meal. Both dosas came with an assortment of chutneys and sambhar. The sambhar was average but the garlic chutney was AMAZING. I asked for more at least five times!   

We ordered the paneer chili fries as an appetizer but they didn't come out until the end of our meal. Even though I was pretty full by then, the spicy aroma made me want to try a bite. They were absolutely scrumptious. The paneer was lightly battered and deep fried to a chewy crisp. It was then cooked and sautéed in the most delicious spicy and thick chili sauce. The paneer chili fries are 100% a must have!   Finally the kothu parotta was a new item that I had never even heard of, let alone tried. But we absolutely LOVED it! The parotta bits were super soft and fluffy and paired elegantly with the potato and other veggies.   

My only complaints were that the restaurant was super packed. Thus waiters would take a long time or forget to accommodate requests. It also wasn't made apparent that dining is driven by the customer unlike a traditional sit down restaurant. You find your own seat, order via a QR code, and pay at the register before leaving. Although they do have options for a waiter to take your order, it does increase the wait time considerably. I honestly didn't mind their efficient, customer driven system but it would have been nice for my parents to have known before hand.","2022-05-11 04:00:03.417497+00:00"
"Kokee Tea","False","True","2","I wanted to try Kokee Tea as I branched out of my go to boba spots. Overall, it honestly wasn't that great. Off of recommendations, I ordered the the House Milk Tea at 75% sweetness with lychee jelly and a Mango Passionfruit at 75% sweetness. Unfortunately, both flavors didn't fit into the flavors that I was looking for. However, the 75% sweetness was a good call however. Probably sticking to KFT lol","2022-05-10 16:35:17.205843+00:00"
"Fry's Spring Station","False","True","4","Fry's Spring Station is a Charlottesville gem hidden on Jefferson Park Avenue. Their food is fresh and delicious without breaking the bank.

Having visited only for dinner, my favorite dishes were their pizza and nachos!

I got the North of the Border Pie which was made up of olives, red onions, jalapeños, cheddar cheese, tomato avocado salad, a house cheese blend, and white sauce. The pizza was super different but absolutely delicious. I highly recommend trying it out!

I also go the Nacho Business for the table made up of black beans, lime crema, jalapeños, queso blanco, salsa fresca, olives, and corn tortilla chips. I wasn't expecting nachos when I walked into the restaurant, but they absolutely delivered!","2022-05-11 05:17:31.527627+00:00"

"MOD Pizza","False","True","4","MOD Pizza off of Rt. 50 is always a good experience. It's difficult to go wrong with a make your own pizza place. MOD never fails to quench my pizza cravings with an 11 inch personal pizza that doesn't break the bank.

You can get unlimited sauces, toppings, and cheeses. So I use MOD as my one excuse to really pile the flavors up. And at the end when picking up your pizza, don't forget to get all the different dressings (both drizzled and on the side)! My favorites are Buffalo sauce, ranch, and srirancha!","2022-05-11 05:16:33.153925+00:00"

The ambiance of the restaurant is homey and is the perfect spot for a date. We ordered the Pink Lady pasta which is pappardelle pasta in an alfredo and house tomato blend. The food was SO GOOD, and honestly all the credit goes to the sauce! They’ve perfected their recipe and it tastes just as amazing upon every visit. 

It does get super packed on weekends, so be sure to call in or arrive super early! ","2022-05-10 18:47:34.143309+00:00"
"The Taco Shack","False","True","4","Close by to a bunch of beach side hotels and houses, taco shack is the perfect quick and easy food spot in Myrtle Beach. Although not the highest quality food, the price and vibes really made up for it. All of their menu items (quesadilla, nachos, soft taco, hard taco) were great with their signature hot sauce and could be easily customized to your liking. 

However, I’ve heard that they closed during COVID 🥺 I hope it’s not true bc this actual hole in the wall had the best beach vibe.","2022-05-11 18:23:01.735402+00:00"
"In-N-Out Burger","False","True","4","I don’t care what anyone else says, In-N-Out Burger hits every time even if you’re vegetarian. Although they don’t have a veggie patty, adding on some of their other toppings creates a worthwhile experience. 

I ordered an animal style grilled cheese which is actually just a veggie burger without the patty. It comes with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, house spread, and onions on bun. I then made it animal style and added chopped chilies. This added pickles, grilled onions, more house spread, pickles, and the chopped chilies. I also ordered animal style which is fries topped with their house spread, grilled onions, and cheese. 

I thought both the burger and fries tasted amazing for fast food. It definitely hit the spot and quenched my in-n-out cravings. Can they please open some on the east coast??? THANK YOU.","2022-05-17 14:48:18.491393+00:00"

"Thai Cuisine & Noodle House","False","True","5","Charlottesville, VA has no lack of Thai restaurants, however Thai Cuisine & Noodle House easily makes it to the top of the list. Customer service is quick and helpful whenever eating in or taking out. Their food is fresh and packed with flavor, especially the spice! Drunken noodles are a classic for my Thai experience, and they 100% deliver. However my favorite dish on the menu is their Boat Noodle!

The drunken noodles balance the sweet and savory flavors with some of the best noodle consistencies I've ever tasted. My friends and I would come in and order a table full of drunken noodles all the time!

The boat noodles at Thai Cuisine & Noodle House was my adventure outside of classic Thai dishes and it instantly became my favorite. The crispy tofu and veggies soaked in spicy brother was a tasting experience that I didn't know I needed. Highly recommend trying them out!","2022-05-11 05:46:15.524018+00:00"

Their Detroit style pizza has everything you could ever want from a pizza slice. The crispy crust is coupled with a thick but airy bread foundation that makes every bite filling yet light. The sauce is rich with basil and garlic and couples perfectly with the cheese and all the toppings.

We ordered the Cheesy Garlic Sticks, Waffle Fries, the MVP, and The Emmy.

The Cheesy Garlic Sticks and Waffle Fries were some of the best appetizers for this meal. Everything was well seasoned and filling, keeping me satisfied until the pizza arrived!

Of the two pies, the MPV was my favorite. It's made of their house made vodka sauce (yes, it's vegetarian), red sauce, cheese, and pesto. All the ingredients paired so well together to create the perfect savory pizza experience. Even though it wasn't the best, the Emmy was also amazing and worth the try. It's made of their white side sauce, banana peppers, red onion, and ranch. Even with the randomness of the ingredients, they all come together for the perfect pizza experience.

I HIGHLY recommend Emmy's to anyone looking for the best pizza in DC. After trying a Detroit slice, you'll never go back!","2022-05-11 05:12:55.172981+00:00"
"District Taco","False","True","4","District Taco is an easy and filling option to fulfill any of your Mexican food cravings. It's super quick and tastes amazing.

We ordered the burrito with homemade guac, rice, black beans, tomato, jalapeno, white onion, lettuce, pico de gallo, shredded cheese, grilled veggies, sour cream, and cilantro. Even though we ordered take out, the meal was big enough to fill two people.","2022-05-10 18:30:37.814999+00:00"
"Abrahams Gyros","False","True","5","Hidden away in the smallest little shop on the Myrtle Beach Boardwalk is Abraham's Gryos and Abraham himself. Both Abraham and his shop are the cutest and honestly have some of the best Mediterranean food I've had in a while!   

Although the menu includes many dishes including falafel, gyros, nachos, fries, and pizza, I decided to go traditional and order a Falafel Sandwich with a side of fries.  The falafel was AMAZING. It was dense yet light and had absorbed barely any oil. The sponginess of the inside paired perfectly with all of their sauces and veggies. The pita on the outside was also perfectly toasted and made for an extraordinary meal. The fries were nice and crispy and paired super well with the gyro sauces.   

The outdoor seating is on the boardwalk and overlooks the beach and ocean making for an extremely chill dining experiences.","2022-05-11 04:01:32.307379+00:00"
"Artichoke Basille's Pizza","False","True","3","There's a lot of hype around Artichoke Basille's Pizza. Although they deliver, it's in a different way than expected!

As an artichoke fan, the Artichoke Pizza is good but it is extremely dense. It's difficult to get through the slice on your own since it's packed with a TON of cheese. Overall, I though the slice was okay but definitely worth the experience.

The surprising turn took with the Margherita Pizza. It was airy and fluffy topped with rich basil infused marinara sauce. This was my favorite slice at Artichoke Basille's Pizza and quickly became one of my favorite margherita pizzas from all of NYC!

Regardless of what you get, Artichoke Basille's Pizza is definitely on the NYC food bucket list.","2022-05-11 05:36:23.735198+00:00"
"The Pigeon Hole","False","True","4","Pigeon Hole is always a solid brunch spot on the corner in Charlottesville, VA. My go-to entree is the huevos rancheros! Coupled with some hot sauce, the dish is the perfect egg filled eat that'll make you want to go back for more.

The aesthetic of the restaurant (both indoors and outdoors) is super cute and nice spend time in. It's definitely a plus when dining at the restaurant!","2022-05-11 05:24:21.886497+00:00"
"Shyndigz","False","True","5","The legendary Shyndigz in Richmond, VA NEVER fails to quench your sweet tooth. Their HUGE cakes and desserts are some of the best I've ever had. Anyone even remotely close to Richmond will constantly insist that you go try this spot out!

Every dessert is so rich and creamy and they all balance sweetness with their innate flavor. There is a touch of homemade magic in each bite.

My go-tos at Shyndigz are their bread pudding and salted caramel chocolate cake.","2022-05-11 05:23:30.424530+00:00"
"Sabai","False","True","2","Sabai Thai had been highly recommended to me by some Richmond natives. Although it's a good option, it did not live up to the hype.

We tried the drunken noodles, panang curry, and Thai iced tea.

The sauce that the noodles should have been immersed in was essentially missing. There wasn't much sweet or savory flavor that came with the noodles outside of the vegetables. The panang curry was better but still okay in that coconut milk flavor was extremely muted. Finally the Thai iced tea had more ice and cream than tea (I would definitely ask for light ice and cream moving forwards).

I love spice and often order Thai hot for myself. However when I went in with a group of friends, they made ALL our food Thai hot, not just mine. Although I was able to take on the spice, the food became virtually inedible for some of my friends! Make sure to clarify the spice levels, especially when dining late.

Sabai is also on the pricier side of Thai restaurants, however the portions do reflect the price making it worth it!","2022-05-11 05:14:44.021978+00:00"
"Bodo's Bagels","False","True","5","Bodo's Bagels is one of my ALL TIME favorite bagel joints. Again biased with nostalgia, but Bodo's has objectively been my go to spot to quench my food cravings since 2015!

Bodo's makes fresh water bagels every single day, giving NYC & NJ bagels a serious run for their money. The soft and flavorful bagels taste consistently amazing and fresh upon every single visit. Everything from fermentation of the bagel itself to to the countless toppings, Bodo's always tastes amazing. Regardless of ordering a bagel sandwich or a classic bagel with cream cheese, Bodo's does not disappoint. The cream cheeses (CC) are also to die for! They have countless flavors and each are whipped to be extremely fluffy and light.

All of their fresh ingredients come together to create the most memorable experience wanting you to go back for more. Everything is also set at an excellent price point!

If you're ever in Charlottesville, VA, Bodo's Bagels is a MUST VISIT!

My favorites include: the everything bagel, jalapeño lime cream cheese (never have had anything like it before), and the pepper spread.

My go-to order which I and many of my peers have HIGHLY RECOMMENDED is: ""an everything bagel w jalapeño lime cream cheese, Swiss or provolone cheese, an egg, lettuce, tomato, onion, sprouts, and pepper spread on the side."" Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed!","2022-05-11 05:25:09.934612+00:00"
"Inchin's Bamboo Garden","False","True","4","Bamboo Garden in Worldgate has some of my favorite indo-chinese dishes in NOVA! My go-to’s are the pan fried chili paneer and crispy chili baby corn. Both are served piping hot, super crispy, and smothered in spicy and flavorful chili sauce. 

Pro-tip: Since both of my favorite dishes are appetizers, go between 2-5 PM to get them for half off during their happy hour! ","2022-05-23 01:08:54.289787+00:00"
"Backyard","False","True","5","The Backyard is a super dope bar & grill in Dallas, TX. They have a super dope semi-closed/semi-open space that’s perfect to hang with your friends! Definitely worth checking it out when in Dallas.","2022-05-18 22:43:20.402328+00:00"
"Brewer's Cafe","False","True","3","Brewer’s Cafe had a tent at the South of the James Farmer’s Market! We stopped by for some coffee but ended up picking up some waffle sticks! 

They look absolutely amazing. However they tasted okay. It was a little hard to eat because of the skewer and there wasn’t much beyond a traditional waffle. The chocolate drizzle and powdered sugar were good but there just wasn’t enough. It was also super light for the price! I’d definitely would want to try out some of the other flavors at the actual shop though! ","2022-06-17 15:39:36.458299+00:00"
"Iron Ice","False","True","1","Although it's been years since my last visit, I remember Iron Ice being very sub-par. The concept is enticing and makes for the perfect Instagram picture, however the quality of the ice cream was extremely disappointing. The puffle was extremely soft and the toppings complemented them well, but the ice cream seemed to shave off and lacked creaminess. I'd recommend Iron Ice for a one time visit just for the pictures.","2022-05-11 05:41:19.064056+00:00"
"Yard House","False","True","4","Yard House is one of my FAVORITE chains to get some classic and vegetarian American food. All of their appetizers are half off after 10 PM from Sunday to Thursday (""happy hour"") and are a game changer! They all taste amazing and are extremely filling.

I highly recommend visiting with a big group during their happy hour and mix-matching all their items. You can make any item vegetarian by substituting their meats for gardein chicken!

My only complaint is that they won't open one closer to me in Fairfax!","2022-05-11 05:39:11.290789+00:00"
"Duck Donuts","False","True","5","As an avid Duck Donuts fan, I was super pumped to try the ORIGINAL Duck Donuts in Duck, NC (near OBX)! We got a huge order, and Duck Donuts Duck did not fail to satisfy! 

All the donuts are freshly fried and made in their kitchen in a separate building. The shop is part of a strip of stores built right on the banks of the ocean creating and nice outdoor ambiance. As always you have the option of ordering their classics, specials, or creating your own flavor combination. You get to choose a base, drizzle, and topping. 

We ordered A BUNCH of options during our trip and loved every single one of them. The staff was also super nice and accommodating with such a large order. When they accidentally forgot a donut and made two of another flavor, they gave us four extra donuts for free! 

I 100% recommend a visit to the historic donut shop!","2022-05-10 16:33:14.960345+00:00"
"Brazos Tacos","False","True","4","Brazos Tacos in Charlottesville, VA (near IX Art Park) is a classic! It's perfect for vegetarians due to their large variety of tacos and ability to accommodate any modifications. However, no matter the taco, Brazos never fails to satisfy!

My favorite breakfast tacos are the I Willie Love You and Migas Taco. The I Willie Love You is made with scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes, sliced avocado, roasted corn pico, and queso fresco. The Migas Taco is egg filled with tomatoes, onions, peppers, tortilla chips, and jack cheese. Both are served on tortilla of your choice.

My favorite go-to tacos are the Triple Pickle, Nacho Taco, and Sir Paul. The Triple Pickle is refried black beans, mushroom bruja, roasted pepitas, jalapeños, red onion pickles, jalapeño pickles, and pickled watermelon with lime. Trust me, I know its sounds weird, but IT IS SO GOOD! The Nacho Taco is more basic with beans, pickled jalapeños, onions, tomatoes, corn chips, and house queso. The Sir Paul is a simpler creation that's made with refried black beans, avocado, roasted corn pico, and roasted pepitas.

Honorable mentions go to the This Is My Yam and Tres Quesos. This Is My Yam is a must try with its crisped sweet potatoes, refried black beans, sliced avocado, queso fresco, and roasted pepitas. Finally the Tres Quesos is a classic with its oaxacan cheese, manchego cheese, queso fresco, refried black beans, sliced avocado, roasted corn pico, and pickled watermelon.

The tacos are on the pricier side and you definitely need 3-4 for it to be filling.","2022-05-10 18:26:24.587997+00:00"
"Duck Donuts","False","True","4","The Duck Donuts in Charlottesville never fails to satisfy. All the donuts are freshly fried in front of you and you have the option with ordering one of their classics or making your own flavor combination. You get to choose a base, drizzle, and topping.

My friends and I visited often and got to try a bunch of different combinations! My favorite however will always be the blueberry dip with a lemon drizzle and Oreo topping. Trust me it's worth it!","2022-05-11 05:07:53.599249+00:00"
"Blaze Pizza","False","True","3","Blaze Pizza on George Mason University's campus is okay. It's difficult to go wrong with a make your own pizza place, so it is pretty enjoyable. You'll be able to quench your pizza cravings with an 11 inch personal pizza that doesn't break the bank.

The best thing about Blaze is that you can get unlimited sauces, toppings, and cheeses. So I use Blaze as my one excuse to really pile the flavors up. And at the end when picking up your pizza, don't forget to get all the different finishes (both drizzled and on the side)! My favorites are Buffalo sauce, ranch, and srirancha!

Hack: If you like pesto, ask for a spicy red sauce base (extra sauce of course) with pesto around the crust!","2022-05-11 05:09:12.753703+00:00"
"Fig Bistro","False","True","3","Fig can be found on the Corner right on the out-skirts of UVA's grounds, which means they are BUSY! The food was great, but was on the pricier side. The service was also very slow simply due to the number of people in the restaurant.

I got the I Dare You Wrap which was made up of a eggs, mushrooms, jalapeños, Cajun potatoes, and cheddar cheese wrapped in a flour tortilla. I did need hot sauce however (for anyone like me who needs the spice). My only major complaint is that the kitchen doesn't take substitutions (only subtractions). As a vegetarian, I was able to take out the bacon from the I Dare You wrap, but wasn't able to substitute it for another vegetable.

The best dish at Fig however is their fried oreos! They make for THE PERFECT dessert. Although a little pricey, I highly recommend at least a one-time try.","2022-05-11 05:30:54.754158+00:00"
"Lampo Neapolitan Pizzeria","False","True","5","Lampo is one of my all time favorite pizza spots and restaurants in Charlottesville, VA! Both their margherita and fungi pies are absolutely delicious. They are perfectly cooked well done without being burnt and have the perfect balance of cheese to sauce to topping.

All the pies are nice and light and have the added fun of cutting it with their massive pizza scissors. The ambiance of the restaurant is also unique with their dim lighting and dark interior. Lampo will always be a must try whenever in Charlottesville!","2022-05-11 05:18:37.531095+00:00"
"One Dee Siam","False","True","3","One Dee Siam has one of the best ambiance's I've seen at a Thai Restaurant outside of New York City. The restaurant is spacious yet cozy.   

I ordered the Pad See Ew (Drunken Noodles) at a hot spice level. The noodles were great but not super memorable. They really bridged them gap between the sweet and savory flavors of drunken noodles. Overall they got the job done!","2022-05-11 04:04:12.266953+00:00"
"The Pinemoor","False","True","4","I LOVED the Pinemoor for their Saturday morning brunch! My group and I had a blast trying all their different appetizers, drink options, and entrees. Their Cheddar Jalapeño Donuts and Baked Brie were some of the most diverse and rich brunch dishes I've ever had. I highly recommend trying both to balance your savory and sweet cravings. Above all, the Southwest Country Burrito (minus the chorizo since I'm vegetarian) was perfect. Scrambled eggs matched with a plethora of ingredients and a side of fries were both filling and satisfying!","2022-05-11 05:47:28.773311+00:00"
"The Nook","False","True","4","The Nook can be found at a prime location in Charlottesville's downtown mall. As a vegetarian, it's a great brunch spot especially if you love eggs. All their eggs dishes are rich and can be modified to your liking. However my favorite dish and now go-to is their Tomato Basil Mac & Cheese. It's super creamy and it's rich flavor perfectly balanced the tomato and basil with the all the gooey cheese. Definitely check it out whenever visiting downtown Charlottesville on a Saturday or Sunday morning!

"El Paso Mexican Restaurant","False","True","1","I saw El Paso Mexican Restaurant and Taqueria in Centreville one day while passing by one day and knew I had to try it. They had some good reviews and a dedicated vegetarian menu, so I was excited. Unfortunately the food did not live up to my expectations at all.  

We ordered the Con Queso Dip as an appetizer and the Super Vegetarian Burrito as an entree.   

The queso was very sub-par and honestly was missing flavor. It was queso blanco and supposedly had jalapeños in it, but there was zero kick. I ended up adding hot sauce to it to bring out some flavor.   

The burrito was essentially an enchilada: flour tortilla stuffed with grilled onions, peppers, spinach, mushrooms, black beans, and rice and topped with sour cream, pico de gallo, cheese, and green sauce. Again even the burrito was very average. None of the filling seems to be seasoned at all. The green sauce was good but definitely could use more of it.   

Any chips and salsa beyond the first is also extra, so beware. I just wanted some salsa to eat with the burrito, but they charged extra! 

There’s really no reason to visit…","2022-05-10 22:20:17.416373+00:00"
"Asado The Wing & Taco Company","False","True","4","Asado Taco & Wing Factory is one of my favorite eats in Charlottesville, VA! All of their food is to die for, and their menu is constantly innovating.

As a vegetarian, I am in love with their Cauliflower Wings (reminds of gobi manchurian with a zesty and spicy twist). All of their sauces complement the dishes well!

Their tacos are also equally as flavorful. My two favorites are the Papas Bravas and Spicy Portobello. Both are filling and satisfying and make my meal each time.

The nachos are HUGE and amazing. The queso is light but packed with flavor and complements all the ingredients perfectly.

Asado's combos make it easy to try multiple dishes without breaking the bank!","2022-05-11 05:37:40.998631+00:00"
"Georgetown Cupcake","False","True","4","Georgetown Cupcake is a classic and one of the more famous spots in Georgetown. Their lines are ALWAYS long, but definitely they move pretty quickly.

The store is small but super cute and modern. All the cupcakes look absolutely amazing - the craftsmanship definitely speaks for itself. The prices are a little high, but again worth for the experience.

I'm excited to go back after the pandemic!","2022-05-11 05:15:19.462484+00:00"
"Antico-Pizza Napoletana","False","True","5","Antico Pizza right outside GT is my favorite pizza spot in Atlanta. I'm usually not a fan of napoletana pizza, but this place throws it out of the park.

The restaurant is tucked away in a literal hole in the wall. They make the pizzas in visible distance and have a dope eating area right next to the counter. It really gives off a low-maintenance street vibe.

The pizzas were absolutely scrumptious. We ordered two Margherita D.O.P.'s, one with Calabrian Peppers and one with Artichoke. The pie's made up of san marzano tomato, bufala (cheese), basil, garlic, and the added topping. They both came well done and slightly charred, which really enhanced and cooked in all the flavors.

While both tasted amazing, the Calabrian peppers stole the show. The peppers were rich in flavor and packed with spice that complemented the garlic and basil. All together each bite was savory with the perfect amount of salt and sour. For all the spice fans like me, they even have extra peppers sitting on the side to add to your meal!

Keep in mind that substitutions, modifications, and half-toppings aren't permitted. So you do have to stick to the options they have, even if you have any dietary restrictions! Regardless, I'm excited to go back and try Antico's again!","2022-05-11 05:11:31.363082+00:00"
"GCDC","False","True","5","GCDC is one of my favorite spots in DC for the perfect grilled cheese sandwich. The sandwiches have some of the best flavors and you can modify any of them to your liking. The bread is also so yummy and is cooked to be super crispy while keeping the cheese nice and gooey on the inside. It is a little pricey, but definitely worth the try once in a while. I'm excited to go back after the pandemic!","2022-05-11 05:14:59.095404+00:00"
"Cook Out","False","True","5","Cookout is some of the best and worst food you’ll have. Absolutely filled with grease, the cookout tray is the perfect answer to your late night hunger! The tray comes with a main, two sides, and a drink. I always get the cheese quesadilla with a side of a cheese quesadilla and Cajun fries. Honorable mentions go to the onion rings and cookout rounds. And a soda or milkshake as a drink. The milkshakes (more so ice cream) can be made of as many combinations of flavors and toppings as you want. The best part however is their sauces: Texas Pete hot sauce, cookout house sauce, and Buffalo sauce. On top of the food every trip to cookout is always memorable and honestly became the home of so many of my college memories! ","2022-05-14 18:19:23.073164+00:00"
"JINYA Ramen Bar","False","True","4","Had Jinya in Reston again on Friday with a couple of friends visiting from out of town. They loved their first jinya experience and honestly the RTC location was much better this time (idk if they’re better during lunch vs dinner). However it did seem like their portions went down 🤔😒 Had a bit of both vegetarian/vegan options, and I’m still placing the Flying Vegan Harvest over the Spicy Creamy Vegan!

"Call Your Mother Deli","False","True","4","Call Your Mother seems to be new the bagel hotspot in DC that everyone can't shut up about. As a bagel fanatic I was excited to try out some of their bagels, cream cheeses, and their speciality bagel sandwiches.   

I ordered the Mountain View and the King's Point.

The Mountain View was a plain bagel filled with bodega-style eggs, american & cheddar cheeses, latke (fried potato), and smashed avocado. Overall it was pretty good! The egg and latke went super well together and made the meal pretty filling. The cheeses were all melted and gooey which was also a huge plus! However I though the bagel was very average (maybe because it was plain?). I'll definitely have to go back to try some of their other bagels and maybe even this sandwich on a different bagel.   

The King's Point was nacho jalapeño cream cheese and crispy shallots on a cheddar bagel (with no bacon). I was super excited for this one just based on the description! Unfortunately the bagel had bacon in it and thus I wasn't able to try it. However I did try a lick of the nacho jalapeño cream cheese, and it tasted SPLENDID. I'm super excited to try the King's Point for real next time!   

Here are some of the things I want to try during future visits to Call Your Mother:

Bagels: Everything, Za'atar, and Maple Salt & Pepper Schmearz: Garlic Herb, Nacho Jalapeño, Vertage Plant-Based Extras: Spicy Honey, Crispy Shallots, Fritos","2022-05-10 22:21:51.754549+00:00"
"TORCHYS","False","True","5","After trying Torchy's in Texas I was so excited to hear about one of my favorite taco joints opening up in Virginia! And they 100% delivered. Torchy's Taco Charlottesville retains the same rich taste in all of its food that makes it so popular in Texas!  

I highly recommend their Green Chile Queso and Chips, it is easily the best queso I've ever had. The guacamole center in the melted cheese and hot sauce is a chef's kiss. Pro tip, as for some extra Diablo sauce on the side to help give it a bigger kick if you like spicy! Torchy's queso and hot sauces really are secret to their success.  

Relative to the queso, the tacos are good but nothing amazing. My favorite tacos however are the Fried Avocado but made trashy with Diablo AND Poblano sauce. The flavors enrich each other for the perfect meal. My next goal is to eat through the entire taco menu, replacing any meats with either fried avocado, eggs, or beans since I'm vegetarian. Im hoping to find a new favorite taco soon!   ","2022-05-11 04:09:27.411813+00:00"

"Tara Thai","False","True","5","Tara Thai was the first place I ever tried Thai Food, and it got me hooked! The Thai cuisine shot up my list and quickly became some of my favorite foods.

The Tara Thai in Charlottesville has some of the best panang curry I've ever had. The dish smells absolutely amazing giving off scents of coconut milk, Thai basil, and Thai spices. Their tofu is perfectly fried and soaks in all of the curry. Tara Thai (specifically in Charlottesville) will always be a goto for me simply because of their panang curry. The drunken noodles here are solid but pretty consistent with other Thai restaurants.","2022-05-11 05:17:54.860373+00:00"
"Domino's Pizza","False","True","5","This is my go to dominos when I’m just craving some classic pizza. Every pie is made to perfection (exactly what you ask for) and is ready super quick. They’re handmade pan is AMAZING; think of a cross between New York and Chicago style pizzas. As a pizza lover, I’m honestly surprised how fulfilling a pie from dominoes is 😂 It’s also great for your wallet! Large for $7.99 with 9174, $3 off for carry out, and the 🐐 deal two 2 topping mediums for $5.99 each with 9193.","2022-05-15 16:48:52.176707+00:00"
"Tijuana Flats","False","True","5","Tijuana Flats has become a must visit whenever I'm in Florida! All of their appetizers, dips, entrees, and desserts are absolutely fresh and amazing. But my favorite part of the dining experience is the hot sauce bar!

My favorite items are the nachos, veggie burrito, and mexican pizza. Other staples include the Tijuana Trio (guac, salsa, and queso), the dos tacos, and their infamous flautas. All of their dishes are packed with flavor, large, and easily customizable. As a vegetarian, I was able to the to try almost every dish without any worries.

If you try the flautas or burrito, make sure you get it ""wet."" For a little bit extra, you can smother it in their red sauce, queso, or verde sauce. Trust me, it's 100% worth it! Also in general, make sure your dish either had a queso or get a side of it because it pairs super well with all their food.

Their chips are also seasoned giving them a nice kick (they come with most dishes). I highly recommend trying out the hot sauces and even buying some bottles for home! My favorite is easily the ""Smack My A** and Call Me Sally.""

If you have a sweet tooth, all their desserts also look delicious,. My go to has always been their cookie dough flautas. It's literally deep fried cookie dough with powdered sugar and chocolate sauce.

Tijuana consistently delivers and this location isn't any different!","2022-05-11 05:05:26.444614+00:00"
"South of the James Market","False","True","4","South of the James Market was a pleasant surprise during my weekend trip to Richmond, VA! It’s open on Saturdays till noon and holds a huge and diverse variety of vendors. 

The tents and trucks are parked right across from the James River and in the heart of the outdoors. It’s super dog friendly, easy to reach via walking or driving, and has lots of parking. There was an awesome combination of food, drink, dessert, plants, wood, natural items, etc. vendors. 

I had some of the best Thai iced tea I’ve ever had, tried an Arepa, and split a waffle stick.

The vendors also rotate, so definitely plan to check it out again and again! Apparently I missed some of the best and most fresh donuts!","2022-06-16 19:10:13.076261+00:00"
"HomeSlyce Pizza Bar","False","True","5","HomeSlyce DC was a pleasant surprise! It’s easily one of the best pizza spots in all of DC and had a super dope sports bar ambiance. They have loads of specialty pies, a cool Georgetown vibe, and amazing food. 

We ordered the HomeSlyce Classic, Port-The-Bella, 1741 Reci-Pie, and Spinach & Artichoke. 

The classic pie is made with HomeSlyce sauce (a blend of tomato, spicy herbs, walnuts, and olive oil), goat and mozzarella cheese, walnuts, eggplant, spinach, caramelized onions, and roasted red peppers. Trust me, even though it sounds like a lot, it was absolutely amazing. All the toppings complemented each other and made for a unique, textured, and super yum pie! 

The port-the-bella was their signature mushroom pie made with garlic sauce, mozzarella cheese, portabella mushrooms, roasted peppers, baby spinach, caramelized onions, and feta. It was definitely one of the better mushroom pies I’ve had. The caramelized onions and feta stood out the most! 

The 1741 reci-pie served as our “risky” order. It’s a pesto sauce pie with mozzarella cheese, pineapples, tomatoes, and jalapeños (instead of sausage). As a jalapeño pineapple lover, I was excited and it definitely delivered. The basily pesto flavors served as the perfect base for spice and sweetness from the jalapeños and pineapples. 

Finally the spinach and artichoke pie stood out because of the garlic and spicy flavors. It was made with fresh spinach and artichoke hearts over garlic herb sauce and topped with ricotta and mozzarella. The pie had a super creamy texture which paired well with the crispy crust. 

The crusts on all the pies were super notable. They tasted sooooo good since they were soft and light yet crispy. They were also brushed with a garlic oil. I absolutely loved the crust and it definitely raised the overall experience.

We also ordered fries and cheese sticks as an appetizer. They were NOT GOOD! I only recommend ordered their pizzas! Regardless, HomeSlyce is still easily a 5/5!

Note that HomeSlyce it is a little expensive, but does match up with the portions and quality and food! The resultant is also easily accessible and there’s street parking right outside! ","2022-06-15 18:56:15.369796+00:00"
"Bar Solita","False","True","5","Finally got a chance to grab brunch at Bar Solita! I’d been wanting to visit for a long time after hearing everyone rave about it, esp @suhani.

We got three different pizzas too split between five of us: the Breakfast, Basil Pesto, and Honey Badger! 

The breakfast pizza is made with jalapeños, two over easy eggs, ricotta, mozzarella, mushroom, red onion, and sliced garlic on a garlic oil base. This was definitely my favorite of the three. All the flavors complemented each other super well and created a savory and slightly spicy experience. One of our friends doesn’t eat egg so we got them on the side, but getting it baked into the pizza is 100% the move. 

The basil pesto pie was Roasted butternut squash, ricotta, mozzarella, red onion, shaved brussels, and pumpkin seeds on a basil pesto base. The basil pesto pizza was honestly pretty mid. It was a cool and earthy experience but it didn’t really fit into my taste palate. 

The honey badger is made on a red pepper pesto base and topped with smoked gouda, red onion, spinach, and mozzarella. It’s then finished with hot honey. I’m not a big fan of smoky pizzas, but for those that are the honey badger is right up their alley! It was also super creamy and baked well. 

I also ordered a side of Buffalo sauce as a dip. It was some of the best Buffalo sauce I’ve ever had! It was creamy and packed with spice and flavors. 

Overall Bar Solita was definitely a hit. The portions might look small, but they fill you up! The menu is super diverse beyond just the pizza so I’m excited to come back to try the wraps, falafel, and much more!

"North Italia","False","True","4","North Italia in Reston Town Center (RTC) has easily some of the most diverse and best desserts I've ever had. As a sweet and salty lover, the Salted Caramel Budino was the perfect mixture of a sweet creamy custard, flaky salt, and a layer of caramel. The rich tastes all worked together to provide an immaculate experience with each bite. Although not a coffee lover, the tiramisu was balanced the chocolate and coffee flavors in the most perfect way. Highly recommend trying out North Italia's desserts for any occasion!","2022-05-11 05:47:58.770060+00:00"
"Heladería Sevilla Reyes Católicos Gioelia Cremeria","False","True","5","Giolatto in Sevilla, Spain is absolutely incredible. Their gelato and sorbets are exceptionally creamy and have the widest assortment of flavors I’ve ever seen. On top of catering to so many different flavors, Giolatto makes all of them fresh every morning in their workshop.

We ordered the Belgian chocolate gelato and lemon sorbet. Both were amazing and packed with flavor. It’s also located right next to a beautiful part of the city and Puente de Isabel II. I highly recommend checking them out! ","2022-05-19 03:27:24.211436+00:00"
"Busaba Thai Fairfax","False","True","2","As an avid Thai lover, Busaba Thai was very okay. Although they had all the proper ingredients, their panang curry didn't produce the balance between sweet and savory that I was looking for. From a price point, it was also expensive to get both veggies and tofu!","2022-05-11 05:43:02.971220+00:00"
"Bodo's Bagels","False","True","5","Bodo's Bagels is one of my ALL TIME favorite bagel joints. Again biased with nostalgia, but Bodo's has objectively been my go to spot to quench my food cravings since 2015!

Bodo's makes fresh water bagels every single day, giving NYC & NJ bagels a serious run for their money. The soft and flavorful bagels taste consistently amazing and fresh upon every single visit. Everything from fermentation of the bagel itself to to the countless toppings, Bodo's always tastes amazing. Regardless of ordering a bagel sandwich or a classic bagel with cream cheese, Bodo's does not disappoint. The cream cheeses (CC) are also to die for! They have countless flavors and each are whipped to be extremely fluffy and light.

All of their fresh ingredients come together to create the most memorable experience wanting you to go back for more. Everything is also set at an excellent price point!

If you're ever in Charlottesville, VA, Bodo's Bagels is a MUST VISIT!

My favorites include: the everything bagel, jalapeño lime cream cheese (never have had anything like it before), and the pepper spread.

My go-to order which I and many of my peers have HIGHLY RECOMMENDED is: ""an everything bagel w jalapeño lime cream cheese, Swiss or provolone cheese, an egg, lettuce, tomato, onion, sprouts, and pepper spread on the side."" Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed!","2022-05-11 05:24:42.019196+00:00"
"Helados la Abuela","False","True","5","La Abuela, found right by the Catedral de Sevilla has some of the best gelato in Spain! Although a chain, they have super cool and diverse flavors and their gelato is unbelievably creamy! 

We tried the cheese cake cheese cake, choco bean, dulce de leche, and blueberry! All of them were amazing and still are memorable. Highly highly recommend the visit when in Sevilla. ","2022-05-16 19:46:40.097373+00:00"
"Voodoo Doughnut","False","True","3","The Voodoo Doughnut at Universal City Walk was a super cool experience. Being in a tourist location, naturally the lines are super long but they are definitely worth the wait. The inside of the store is built super well with conveyer belts of donuts and colors all over the walls. My family and I loved the experience! All the donuts are also well crafted and give off an aesthetic and premium vibe. I highly recommend checking it out if you're visiting Orlando or Universal Studios!","2022-05-11 05:43:35.580024+00:00"
"We The Pizza","False","True","3","We, The Pizza was a great ""above the average"" pizza option in Capitol Hill! They provided both pie and by the slice options with an extremely large variety of options. I highly recommend trying the Veg Sicilian Pie - it has the perfect combination of a crispy and thick crust with a great combination of toppings! The Margherita Burrata was solid but could've been thinner being a traditional pie! Overall, it's 100% worth the experience!","2022-05-11 05:48:41.231364+00:00"
"Orfeo Cafe/Bar","False","True","3","Orfeo Cafe & Bar is a small and cozy eatery in Sevilla! It has cute coffee shop vibes with a bunch of breakfast/brunch items. 

We ordered various bread items. They’re essentially meant to be simple bread with blank dishes. We tried, avocado, goat cheese, hummus, tomato, and combinations of them as well. Overall I thought it was average but my friends liked the coffee! ","2022-05-16 21:56:32.934218+00:00"
"Joe's Pizza","False","True","1","Joe's Pizza carries a lot of history being one of the older pizza shops in the city and it's fame spot in Spider-Man. However the food doesn't reflect the history or helpful nature of the staff.

Joe's classic cheese slices were okay at best. The slice was very floppy and crust was burned. Although thin and light, it just lacked flavor. I would recommend visiting once out of completeness, but there is nothing special to see.

P.S. Keep cash handy because they don't accept credit cards and the ATM outside the shop has super high fees!","2022-05-11 05:34:36.532926+00:00"
"The Patio Thai Restaurant","False","True","5","I have now visited Patio Thai a couple times, and can confidently say that it’s one of my favorite Thai restaurants of all time! Everything from the food to the staff and ambiance makes for a great dining experience. Trust me you HAVE TO try it, when in RVA. 

I’ve tried the drunken noodles, panang curry, pineapple fried rice, and Thai iced tea. 

The drunken noodles are nearly perfect. Portions are a little smaller relative to the other Thai restaurants but it’s still super filling - you just might not be able to take some home. But they are consistently soft and packed with sweet savory flavors. The noodles aren’t too oily but are cooked and coated in the perfect amount of sauce. The tofu is also super spongy and soaks in all the flavors. I’d go back all the time for their drunken noodles if I could! 

The panang curry is so freaking good - again one my all time favorite panang curries of all time. The coconut milk’s sweetness perfectly balances the spice of the other ingredients. The tofu soaks in all the curry and the dish has a good ratio of vegetable and tofu. The curry tastes super fresh and yummy every single time! 

The pineapple fried rice portions were insanely huge. They fill an entire half pineapple with rice and then some. Overall it was pretty good and super spicy, but nothing amazing. The pineapples are good but not grilled. The rice and spice flavors mix well with the tofu, cashews, and veggies as well. The cashews do add a nice crunch and texture that could be tried with the curries. It might be worth a try, but I’ve had better elsewhere. 

The Thai iced tea was solid and as per usual, however I’ve had better. They did follow my instructions for light ice and cream, which is definitely a plus!

Pro tip: get both the drunken noodles and panang curry. Dipping your noodles in the curry makes for the perfect Thai experience since the flavors compliment each other so well. ","2022-06-16 18:42:51.359452+00:00"
"The Merchant","False","True","5","The Merchant is an Irish Pub/International Restaurant that we stumbled into during our time in Sevilla. Even though our visit wasn't pre-planned, it ended up being one of my favorite meals in Spain! 

We ordered nachos, vegetarian quesadillas, and vegetarian burritos. All the dishes were fresh, had large portions, and were vegetarian friendly. 

The nachos had melted cheese, red onion, jalapeños, and homemade salsa on homemade tortilla chips. The cheese and tortilla chips just tasted so different than in the US and it really made the meal. 

The quesadilla was tortilla stuffed with salsa, grilled vegetables, red onion, and melted cheese. Again all of the ingredients complimented each other super well and made for a delicious meal. 

Finally the burrito was tortilla stuffed with grilled vegetables, red onion, and melted cheese that was then deep fried and served with cheese, salsa, cilantro, chips, and guacamole. 

Overall we loved our experience at Merchant. With a large two story space, they were able to accommodate our large group of 10+. The staff was also welcoming and treated us well.","2022-05-19 03:17:40.033503+00:00"
"Wiseguy Pizza","False","True","4","Wiseguy Pizza is one of the best pizza spots in DC. They have some super dope specialty pies that always hit the spot and never fail to satisfy. Each slice is crispy yet light and has the perfect ratio of cheese to topping to sauce. They're also always cooked to well done!

Here I tried the Paneer Tikka and Backyard. 

As a huge fan of Indian fusion pizza, Wiseguy definitely has some of the best Paneer Tikka slices. It's a jalapeño sauce with house masala, paneer, mozzarella, onion, tomatoes, green peppers, chili peppers, and cilantro. The base sauce is nice and spicy which really helps bring out all the masala flavors. Each of the toppings fit right into each other. But my favorite part of the experience has to be jalapeño sauce drizzle! It's spice and savor sets it apart from any other paneer slice I've had!

The Backyard has tomato base with vegan cheese, green peppers, mushrooms, red onions, chili peppers, spices, and extra virgin olive oil. Overall the slice was okay. It tasted like a standard veggie slice.","2022-05-10 19:28:20.946845+00:00"
"DC Pie Co","False","True","4","DC PIE CO in Brickell Miami was one of my favorite pizza spots in all of the Florida. The pie was massive and you know it's good when you have to wait an hour in the middle of the day on a Monday. 

I ordered the Brooklyn Brick Oven Pie which is made from their delicious homemade sauce, Italian imported mozzarella di bufala, fresh mozzarella, and eighteen month aged parmigiano reggiano, basil, and garlic. The slice was thin and light but with the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese. The sauce was packed with flavors that complemented the garlic and basil super well. The basil was super fresh and really enhanced the experience (they give a BUNCH on the side as well!). The crust was okay however in that it was cooked well done to a crisp. This caused it to become brittle and loose its chewiness. 

Overall, I loved DC PIE CO and would 100% recommend it to anyone visiting or in Miami!","2022-05-10 16:29:53.935992+00:00"
"The Continental Divide","False","True","3","Continental Divide was an okay Tex-Amex option in downtown Charlottesville, VA. As vegetarians, we modified the Santa Fe Enchiladas by removing the chicken and replacing it with spinach, mushrooms, or beans!

Each of the dishes had their own distinct taste and was definitely different relative to other traditional Tex-Med spots. I recommend giving it a try out of completeness, but it's nothing special.","2022-05-11 05:22:28.103509+00:00"
"Percy's Pizza","False","True","4","For a $1 slice, I really can't complain about Percy's Pizza! It definitely wasn't the best slice I've had but it's consistently has been solid. My favorite part of the slice is the crispy crust!","2022-05-11 05:35:49.003663+00:00"
"Thai '99 II Restaurant","False","True","2","Although a solid option, relative to the other Thai options in Charlottesville, VA Thai '99 doesn't meet the standard. The panang curry was good but didn't have packs of flavor in each bite and the tofu could be made crispier. Drunken noodles were good but again were lacking some of the sweetness that makes the dish!","2022-05-11 05:45:01.725121+00:00"
"Got Dumplings","False","True","5","As an UVA alumni, I may be a little biased but Got Dumplings has THE BEST dumplings I've ever had. Their tofu dumplings are savory and crispy and match perfectly with their dumpling sauce. The cold noodle with peanut sauce is unique and refreshing on a hot day. The egg fried rice is rich and perfect for a cold rainy afternoon. Got Dumplings never disappoints!","2022-05-11 05:45:59.171180+00:00"
"Pommes Frites","False","True","3","Pommes Frites sounds amazing: FRIES & SAUCES!

Pommes Frites on McDougal Street has made to order fries with LOADS of sauces to chose from. The restaurant is tucked away under the buildings on the street for a dope old European vibe.

The portions are good, especially if you're looking for a snack. Make sure to get the sauce combos so you can try all the different sauces!

The fries were super crispy and piping hot. My favorite sauces were the garlic aioli, European mayonnaise, and war sauce.","2022-05-11 05:35:09.966156+00:00"
"Velvet Taco","False","True","5","Velvet Taco is one of my all time favorite taco spots in Texas! They have a wide variety of flavors and everything can be easily modified. It's also probably the most ""different"" taco spot, making it a must visit. 

I've tried all four vegetarian adoptions: Nashville Hot Tofu, Fried Paneer, Falafel, and Beer Battered Cauliflower. The Nashville Hot Tofu is made up of crispy tofu, napa slaw, ranch crema, and house brined pickles on a flour tortilla. It's one of their best ones and highly recommend it to anyone trying to get a Nashville hot chicken vibe. The fried paneer is crispy paneer, tomato chutney, tikka sauce, raita crema, and Thai basil all on a flour tortilla. This taco also always hits the spot and creates the perfect Indian-Mexican fusion experience. The Falafel is tahini crema, arugula, tomato, pickled fresnos, avocado, pickled red onion and pea tendrils on a lettuce wrap but you can ask for a tortilla! Finally the Beer Battered Cauliflower is my favorite and is made up of queso blanco, Texas Pete sabor sauce, avocado corn pico, and dusted candied pepitas on a flour tortilla. This taco balances all the flavors and is absolutely AMAZING! 

Pro tip: Make sure you try both sauces they have on the tables. Both truly enhance the experience. 

The queso was okay, but worth a one time try. But their red velvet cake was TO DIE FOR! Will definitely be getting that again!","2022-05-10 16:17:00.737040+00:00"
"Now and Zen","False","True","5","As a vegetarian, it's often extremely difficult to find quality sushi places (I want more than the standard avocado or cucumber roles!). Now and Zen 100% delivers with their Green Giant!

Made up of a sweet potato tempura, cream cheese, avocado, cucumber, spicy mayonnaise, vegan eel sauce, tempura flakes, and scallions, the Green Giant creates an amalgamation of flavors unlike any other. Paired with wasabi, ginger, and their house spicy mayonnaise, each bite packs a punch!

I highly recommend Now and Zen (specifically the Green Giant) to both sushi newbies and enthusiasts alike!","2022-05-11 05:38:55.000857+00:00"
"100 Montaditos","False","True","5","100 Montaditos was one of the best and most memorable restaurants I visited in all of Spain. Although simple, their tiny baguette sandwiches were absolutely amazing and listed at a super reasonable price. 

They literally have 100 sandwiches to chose from, so there’s something for everyone’s taste palate. I found that my favorites were those with pesto, goat cheese, and fried onion! Having so many sandwiches to chose from also means that they have great vegetarian and vegan options. Each sandwich comes with a side of potato chips.

Overall we loved our food experience at 100 Montaditos so much that we visited other locations later in our trip just so that we could try more! ","2022-05-16 19:38:02.505745+00:00"
"Gringos Locos","False","True","3","Gringos Locos is one of my favorite taco joints and chains in Orlando! The Double D taco never fails to disappoint.

"The Bagel Store","False","True","4","I visited specifically to try the Rainbow Bagel, and if did not disappoint. The bagel was surprising sweet and paired perfectly with the jalapeño cream cheese. Together they created this perfect combination of sweet and spicy, making me hungry for more!

I highly recommend the trek out to Brooklyn both for this touristy rainbow bagel but also for any of their bagels and cream cheeses! Easily one of the best bagel spots, I've visited!","2022-05-11 05:33:53.405007+00:00"
"Mr Shawarma","False","True","4","On of my friends in the VA Beach/Norfolk area recommended Mr. Shawarma to me as one of top five Mediterranean restaurants of all time. Al though I have many more to explore, Mr. Shawarma did not disappoint!

Everything from the softness of the pita bread, to the flavor and crispiness of the falafel, to the richness and creaminess of all the sauces, to the crunchiness of the fries, Mr. Shawarma was amazing!

I recommend either getting their bowl or plate!","2022-05-11 05:16:07.562068+00:00"
"Amsterdam Falafelshop","False","True","5","Amsterdam Falafelshop is one of my favorite falafel joints in Washington D.C.! Tucked away in Adams Morgan, Amsterdam Falafel never fails to satisfy and is an awesome spot. 

I've tried both the falafel sandwich and bowl. I get the falafel, hummus, red cabbage, cucumber dill onion, crunchy onion sauce, pickled cauliflower, red pepper sauce, garlic cream, tahini, and pickled turnips all with a side of their fries and spicy ketchup! The falafels are dense and packed with flavor. They break easily and really combine well with all the sauces and toppings. Both the sandwich and bowl are filling and pair great with the super crispy fries.

I highly recommend Amsterdam Falafelshop to anyone looking for a fresh and tasty Mediterranean meal. Adams Morgan is also a GREAT place to explore so it's definitely worth checking out!","2022-05-09 19:27:53.106660+00:00"
"Velvet Taco","False","True","5","Velvet Taco has easily some of the best tacos in Texas, and frankly in the US! All of their tacos are diverse and create a unique amalgamation of flavors that can't be found anywhere else. My favorite was their Fried Paneer Taco; it was spicy and rich in every bite. Customer service was also top notch and fast, even thought I visited at 1 AM!","2022-05-11 05:47:14.280788+00:00"
"Red Robin","False","True","5","Red Robin is one of my favorite burger chains. It's greasy and heavy, just a like burger and fries should be!

My favorite dish of the menu is the Burnin' Love with onion straws and a side of garlic fries. When dining in, you have to go bottomless with the fries.

Red Robin also has some AMAZING sauces to choose from with their campfire sauce, poppyseed-honey mustard, and brand new buzz sauce being my favorites!

P.S. if you join Red Robin Rewards, you get a FREE birthday burger every year!","2022-05-11 05:13:54.397958+00:00"
"dŌ","False","True","2","Dō, both at their store and at the NYC Smorgasburg, was a super cool and unique experience. The edible cookie dough is unlike any other cookie or ice cream dessert. It's honestly difficult to describe what it feels like exactly but it is definitely more moist than other cookie dough spots! Highly recommend for the experience, they were just too sweet for me!","2022-05-11 05:41:02.616290+00:00"
"Silk Thai Restaurant","False","True","4","Silk Thai is a great Thai find in Charlottesville, VA. Tucked away right of off of UVA's grounds, it's in a prime location for anyone looking for a tasty and filling meal.

My favorite item on their menu is their Drunken Noodles with Veggies & Tofu (ask them to make the tofu extra crispy - trust me it's so worth!).

For anyone who likes spice, their Thai Hot can be handled and is honestly worth the try.","2022-05-11 05:45:44.953788+00:00"
"Big Buns","False","True","3","I’d heard a lot about Big Buns, so was super excited to try their damn good burgers with @vignesh! The menu consists of a bunch of designer burgers and an option to build your own. They have both veggie and impossible patties as options for vegetarians. 

I made my own since none of the designer burgers looked super amazing. However I wanted to cater to my own taste palate and combine specific parts of each. I got a veggie patty with lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, onions, pickled onions, jalapeños, mushrooms, sautéed onions, and honey mustard. Overall the burger was very mid. The patty was solid but wasn’t anything special and was a little dry. The sauces also tastes standard.  

I also tried a bit of the Hot & Hefe. It was made with a veggie patty, pepper Jack cheese, avocado, grilled habanero and serano pico de gallo, and sriracha aioli. I liked it a lot better than my build your own, but again it was nothing ground breaking. I’ve had similar burgers before! The patty was still dry but the sandwich came together more cohesively. 

We also got fries and a shake on the side. The regular freis were dry and not seasoned at all. The cajun fries were seasoned super well but weren’t crispy at all. I also wish they had more access and variety of dipping sauces. They charge for getting more than one! The chocolate shake was a solid addition. 

Overall the ambiance was dope. It’s a large restaurant with open seating and lots of paper towels rolls (trust me you’ll need them!). Keep in mind that food was on the pricier side. 

It’s location at Reston Metro Center was a huge turn off. The parking garage is extremely difficult to navigate and understand.","2022-06-22 18:47:55.886837+00:00"
"First Watch","False","True","4","First Watch is one of my favorite brunch spots. Being a chain, I was a little skeptical at first but First Watch delivers every single time and at every location. All of their dishes are packed with flavor and loads of fresh ingredients creating the perfect balanced meal. They also have so much variety on their menu that you can try a different dish each time.

My favorite dishes to date are the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes (no longer seasonal), Market Veggie sandwich, and the Tomato Basil soup. So this time we got all of our go-tos and tried the brand new and seasonal blueberry muffin top griddle cakes!

The Lemon Ricotta Pancakes are no longer seasonal so go get them NOW! They're some of the fluffiest pancakes I've had and pair so well with the lemon ricotta cream and strawberries. The dish holds the perfect amount of sweetness and is super filling. 

The Market Veggie Sandwich also always satisfies. It's made up of house-roasted crimini mushrooms, zucchini, spinach, pesto, mayo, and mozzarella cheese on grilled artisan whole grain. This time the market veggie was much creamier, which was unexpected but super yummy. The sandwich is light yet filling and pairs super well with their basil tomato soup. It’s creamy, savory, and chunky, making it the perfect addition. 

The blueberry muffin top griddle cakes were so sooooo good. It comes as three house-baked, butter-griddled blueberry and cinnamon streusel muffin tops, topped with warm mixed berry compote, blueberries, strawberries and blackberries, housemade granola, and powdered cinnamon sugar. It literally tasted like a muffin top with berry sweetness. The granola was the perfect touch since it added a crunch and texture to the meal. They were super fluffy yet filling. I also added a touch of their warm and fresh syrup to tie the meal together! Hot take, it was better than the lemon ricotta! 

We also ordered a side of their breakfast potatoes which were awesome.

Other than the food, I felt that the restaurant was not very accommodating in regards to reservations, large parties, moving tables, birthdays, etc. The food was phenomenal but the staff and treatment just wasn’t it. Would’ve been a five otherwise! ","2022-06-13 18:35:26.291832+00:00"
"Boylan Heights","False","True","4","Outside of being UVA's hotspot from Thursday-Saturday night, Boylan Heights has some of the best food in Charlottesville. Their burgers have always been a fan favorite especially when paired with their cheesy tots and milkshakes! The restaurant is also the one with the coolest aesthetic on UVA's corner with dope decorations, lighting, and ambiance. You even order your food on a scantron!

They used to have the BEST QUINOA PATTY that was perfect for me as a vegetarian. Although the new patty isn't the same (pre-2019), Boylan's veggie burger still hits the spot. I'm excited to hit it up again on my next visit!","2022-05-11 05:26:38.508946+00:00"
"Falafel Inc","False","True","5","Falafel Inc is one of my FAVORITE falafel spots and restaurants in general in Washington DC, and the location in Georgetown does not disappoint! Falafel Inc is quick, delicious, and super affordable. They're entire menu is vegetarian but still fills your right up!

I ordered both the falafel sandwich and bowl. Both dishes were simple yet packed with the flavor. All the ingredients were super fresh and accompanied each other so well. Oh and don't forget to add hummus!

The falafel sandwich comes with falafel, lettuce, pickled red cabbage, pali salad, mazbout sauce, and red sauce all packed in a fresh baked pita pocket. It's fresh, huge, and delicious for just $4. 

The falafel bowl comes with falafel, red cabbage, tabouli, pickles, zaatar chips, greens, and a special sauce. Again it's fresh, sizable, and scrumptious for just $5. 

Their best side is their Zaatar fries. The fries are super crispy and packed with an aromatic, savory, and salty flavor. They are well seasoned so that every bite gets a fresh and flavor packed punch. You get so many fries just for $3. 

Finally my favorite part of the meal are all their sauces. As an avid sauce fanatic, I loved all of them! Mixing and matching makes every visit it's own experience. The sauces in my ranked order from best to least best would be the Habibi sauce (garlic-y with a little spice), Invisible sauce (jalapeno-y with lots of spice), White sauce (mayo-based white falafel sauce), Red sauce (spicy), Mazbout sauce (tahini), and Garlic sauce (garlic-y and lemony). 

Give Falafel Inc a try, trust me you and your wallet will love it!","2022-05-10 16:23:07.468649+00:00"

"Alameda 5","False","True","4","We stopped by Alameda 5 to watch the 2019 Copa del Rey finals between Valencia and FC Barcelona! Lucky for us the sports bar also had a diverse and versatile menu. 

I ordered the Alameda spicy potatoes. It was essentially seasoned potato wedges topped with a spicy and creamy marinara sauce. It was a good and filling meal for €6! 

The vibes of the restaurant and the area around it was also super nice. The streets were large and full of people and peace. ","2022-05-19 04:10:56.389432+00:00"

It definitely enhanced the dining experience. All the food was also plated well and really matched ambiance of the restaurant.

We ordered the Deconstructed Aloo Tikki Chat and Deconstructed Samosa Chat. Both were good, but nothing special. The aloo tikki and samosa itself were both fried well and crispy, but the chickpea curry gravy wasn't that great. It's a good place to check out if you're really craving Indian street eats, but I would recommend trying something else on the menu!","2022-05-11 04:11:07.311269+00:00"
"Milk Bar","False","True","5","This was my first time at a Milk Bar, and I absolutely LOVED IT! The cereal milk soft serve is such a unique flavor and really does taste like the milk left after eating a bowl of cereal. I still struggle understanding how the best part of breakfast became an ice cream flavor!

Although they have a wide selection of options, I recommend going with the classic cereal milk soft serve with a crunch! You'll get to experience the creaminess and soft texture of the soft serve while tasting a never before seen ice cream flavor!","2022-05-11 05:31:49.771782+00:00"
"Fuzzy's Taco Shop","False","True","2","I visited Fuzzy's Taco Shop when they first opened in Charlottesville, VA. Overall, I wasn't really impressed. Their food was okay, but nothing memorable. The taco portions were also a little small relative to the price point so I never really visited again. However since it's been a couple of years, I'm excited to try Fuzzy's again to see what's changed!","2022-05-11 05:18:52.209211+00:00"
"Best Bagel & Coffee","False","True","4","Best Bagel & Coffee is one of my favorite bagel spots in NYC! The soft and steamy bagels are the perfect representation of a New York bagel.

As a n avid bagel fan, I always try to go off the rails with my bagel sandwiches. After multiple visits, my favorite creation at Best Bagel & Coffee is an Everything Bagel with Jalapeño and Sun Dried Tomato CC, egg, lettuce, tomato, onion, hot peppers, and pickles!

Even if the line is extremely long (usually out the door lol), I HIGHLY recommend the wait!","2022-05-11 05:36:42.337131+00:00"
"Best Pizza","False","True","4","Tucked away in Williamsburg, I almost missed this place! Although it wasn't my favorite pizza in NYC, it definitely was memorable.

My favorite was the classic cheese followed by the white pie and then the seasonal vegetable. The flavors of the sauce, toppings, and crust balanced each other well and portions were on par with the price.

As a vegetarian, I gave the seasonal vegetable slice a try since it looked different than any other vegetable pizza I'd ever had. My slice had bell peppers, kale, and cauliflower which didn't mix well with the cheese and crust in my opinion.

The pizza shop itself was super dope and the staff was super accommodating. All plate artwork and shop decorations were definitely a plus!","2022-05-11 05:33:32.341645+00:00"
"Matchbox","False","True","4","Matchbox in One Loudoun always hits the spot. Placed in a cute and social meetup spot, Matchbox is in the perfect location for a date or quality time with friends and family.

All their pies are super light yet crispy. Each is packed with flavor and I highly recommend trying any one of their specialty pies.  

We ordered the Fire + Smoke, Garden Veggie, and one create your own. The Fire + Smoke was my favorite of them all made up of a chipotle purée, roasted garlic, onions, red peppers, smoked gouda, basil, and a zesty tomato sauce. The pie was cooked till well done with a light char. The Garden Veggies was a close second made up of a zesty tomato sauce, mozzarella, a medley of roasted veggies, herbs, and cilantro jalapeño oil.

The food is on the pricier side, ESPECIALLY for pizza. So that's just one thing to keep in mind!","2022-05-11 05:08:15.380954+00:00"
"Jumbo Slice Pizza","False","True","2","We got the classic cheese at Jumbo Slice Pizza in Adams Morgan. Overall it was very very okay. The jumbo slice was cool, but I've had big pizza before (check out Benny’s 👀). Other than the size there wasn't anything special. I'd only recommend it if you're REALLY craving pizza or want a cheap meal in Adams Morgan!","2022-05-09 19:26:39.760790+00:00"
"Jaiya","False","True","4","Jaiya Thai had some of the best Thai food I've had in NYC. Their drunken noodles were of the perfect consistency and absorbed all the Asian/Thai flavors. The panang curry's coconut milk truly made the dish and paired super well with their fried tofu.

However my favorite part of the meal was the spice. As an extremely spicy eater, Jaiya Thai was able to cook all their dishes to be Thai Hot without compromising the taste!","2022-05-11 05:37:01.184386+00:00"
"The Roost","False","True","5","Ever since I stumbled upon the Roost on tiktok, I've been excited to visit! It's essentially a brand new food hall on Capitol Hill!

The space looks newly built and is extremely spacious. It was a little confusing to figure out how seating and ordering works, but their is staff around the entire food hall to help! But pretty much, you find any open seat and scan the QR code associated with that seat. From there you can order and pay for all your food right from the site. There is both indoor and outdoor seating and a WIDE VARIETY of restaurants to chose from!

Some of them include HiFi Taco Shop, State Fair, Ako by Kenaki, Slice Joint, Yoko & Kota, Leni, and much more!

We got the square cheese pizza from the Slice Joint and three sets of noodles from Yoko & Kota (Peanut and Citrus Chili Oil Rice Noodles, Tomato and Sesame Rice Noodles, Black Bean and Coconut Rice Noodles).

The pizza was pretty good but just a tad bit salty. Overall the noodles were very okay, with the Black Bean & Coconut Rice Noodles being the best!","2022-05-11 05:31:12.607751+00:00"
"Gelateria Artesanal","False","True","4","Gelateria Artesanal can be found as a small shop on La Rambla. On a hot summer day, all of their various assorted flavors are the perfect pick me up. All of the gelato flavors we tried were super creamy and extend my fresh! Definitely recommend a visit when in Barcelona! ","2022-05-11 20:32:55.873381+00:00"
"Main Slice","False","True","1","The Main Slice had some of the worst pizza I've ever tried. They have super long wait times and if ordering by the slice, the pizza comes cold. I was excited to try it because of all of their fancy and specialty pizza toppings. But it looked 100x better than it tasted. Would not recommend!","2022-05-11 18:27:21.903545+00:00"
"Mai Thai","False","True","4","Mai Thai in Georgetown is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in DC! All of their dishes were fresh and packed with flavor. Pro tip: you get a free entree on your birthday! Sadly I visited the day before haha!

We ordered the Fresh Garden Rolls, Drunken Noodle, and Pad Thai. The rolls were fresh and simple, yet elegant. I definitely recommend as a light appetizer. The drunken noodles were SOLID. The tofu was super crispy and soaked in the sauce from the noodles and veggies. It was packed with the traditional drunken noodle flavor you'd expect. The pad thai was good, but definitely could have been better. The lime was necessary for all the flavors to mix, but I wish there was a bit more given!

Overall, I loved my experience at Mai Thai and plan on visiting again soon!","2022-05-11 05:14:13.805920+00:00"
"California Pizza Kitchen","False","True","3","California Pizza Kitchen has always been a go-to spot for American small plates, appetizers, and pizzas. All of their dishes can be accommodated to most dietary restrictions while still retaining the quality and taste!  

This time we ordered the spinach artichoke dip and sedona tortilla soup. 

The spinach artichoke dip was easily on the creamiest dips I’ve ever had. It was super savory and packed with perfectly balanced flavors. You could distinguish the texture and tastes of the spinach, artichoke, and garlic in every bite. The tortilla chips were fresh and crispy well. 

The Sedona tortilla soup was a 5/5 as per usual. It’s made from vine-ripened tomatoes, tomatillos, corn, mild green chilies, Southwestern spices, and crispy corn tortilla strips. The soup was thick and creamy with load of flavorful and juicy corn in every bite. All the flavors fit together super well and was definitely worth! 

Although the food was great, the dining experience was not at the same level. The booth we were seated at was extremely small. It was hard to sit and eat because of how close the seats were to the table. We had to ask for bread multiple times (normally served without asking) and each time the bread was in super small quantities and cold. The staff also took a long time to check in and respond to requests. Probably will elect to visit the Fairfax Co. location in the future! ","2022-06-15 18:13:05.262436+00:00"
"Dominique Ansel Bakery","False","True","4","I visited Dominique Ansel Bakery for their famous Chocolate Chip Cookie shots! They were soft, moist, and contained the perfect amount of sweetness. I was honestly surprised to see how well they held and worked. The Madagascan Vanilla Milk was also a nice surprise and honestly made the entire experience that much tastier and more unique. I highly recommend trying out the cookie shots and any other items at Dominique Ansel Bakery whenever in New York City!

P.S. Due to its popularity, the lines are extremely LONG! So just be ready to spend some time at the bakery before getting your shots!","2022-05-11 05:39:44.049478+00:00"
"Mission","False","True","4","Mission in DuPont Circle is an awesome brunch spot for you and your friends. Ever since COVID, they've taken over the space outside of the restaurant which aggressively increased their seating. That being said, Mission is constantly PACKED! So be ready to wait a bit for your order as well as drink refills.  

We ordered the breakfast quesadilla and nachos. Both were amazing and SUPER FILLING. Portions were pretty big and price was surprisingly not that bad. The menu is super vegetarian friendly where you can replace any protein with beans, potatoes, or mushrooms. I got mushrooms in my quesadilla, and they were delicious. All the ingredients were cooked in this super savory seasoning that paired super well with their side sauce. 

A cool option to try is the nachos but on fries rather than chips. It was a refreshing potato dish that had the perfect balance of flavors and textures!","2022-05-10 16:31:20.577776+00:00"
"Shake Shack","False","True","4","This was my first Shake Shack experience and I was NOT disappointed. I was skeptical trying a mushroom based patty for the first time, but the flavors mixing with the cheese was amazing. Highly recommend this Shake Shack to anyone on I-Drive. Also ask for their cherry peppers on your sandwich, you won't regret it!","2022-05-11 05:44:47.053627+00:00"
"Taco Mahal","False","True","5","Taco Mahal was a ~savory~ surprise on Bleecker Street! Discovered off of Instagram, I was definitely hesitant at first to try the Mexican-Indian fusion restaurant. But Taco Mahal did not disappoint!

The flavors were rich and warm coming together for a fantastic snack! Although I only tried one, I highly recommend the paneer tikka masala taco. It's pretty much like eating Indian food in a Mexican presentation.

The dish made for some great pictures as well!","2022-05-11 05:37:17.560430+00:00"
"Venice Pizza","False","True","3","Finding a random pizza spot is always highlight of a late night road trip. Although Venice Pizza didn’t have the highest quality pizza, it 100% hit the spot. 

We ordered the XL cheese pie for $13 special. Overall the pizza was solid. However it was EXTREMELY cheesy and hella oily. The cheese was good and was layered with seasonings but the sauce was too watery. This caused the cheese to constantly slide off. The crust was nice and thin but was still chewy.

The structure of the pizza was the problem. The pizza definitely hit after driving for four hours but definitely could have been better. 

We also ordered the cheesy garlic bread to taste. The filling was good but it definitely was a little salty and slightly burnt. 

If you’re looking for a dope late night eat with a pool of cheese, oil, and love, stop by Venice Pizza in MD! ","2022-06-23 13:22:40.478185+00:00"
"La Taqueria","False","True","4","Located minutes away from the Sagrada Familia, the La Taqueria was a dope authentic Mexican eatery. Although it looks small, they have a huge back room that could accommodate our large group of 10+. 

We ordered the nachos la cúcara which was fresh tortilla chips topped with cheese, refried beans, pico de gallo and jalapeños with a sour cream drizzle. The nachos were honestly top tier. They also had a cool assortment of drinks and sodas to chose from. 

My favorite part however was the assortment of salsas and hot sauce they brought to our table on the side. They were super flavorful and definitely enhanced the dining experience. 

I highly recommend stopping by La Taqueria in Barcelona, especially if checking out the Sagrada Familia. ","2022-05-16 15:58:08.372328+00:00"
"Little Lucy's Mini Donuts","False","True","5","Little Lucy’s Mini Donuts is a small food truck on Rainey Street. Even though the donuts are mini, they definitely pack a punch of flavor! 

They have a WIDE assortment of donuts and make them fresh right in front of your eyes. You can get six for $6 or twelve for $9. After spending like half an hour taking in the aroma of fresh donuts and debating between flavors, we ended up ordering the Blueberry & Lemongrass donuts. 

They were SOOO GOOD! Each donut really encapsulated all the flavors and brought freshness to every bite. I appreciated that they weren’t oily but still fluffy and easy to bite into. The blueberry flavors paired perfectly with the warmth of the lemongrass. This made the Blueberry & Lemongrass donut an unique experience for sure! 

When in Austin, I would 100% come back to try some of the other flavors! ","2022-07-08 15:39:04.102087+00:00"
"Baby Jalebi","False","True","3","Baby Jalebi was a cool Indian street food spot in Barcelona! It had a dope neon lights vibe and quick street food eats. Overall the food was solid but the service took WAY too long. Definitely would not recommend if traveling with a large group. ","2022-05-11 20:20:15.791112+00:00"
"Tiki Thai","False","True","3","Tiki Thai was a pleasant NOVA Thai experience. The service was okay in that our table didn't get too much attention and the restaurant was a little cramped in regards to seating. However the Drunken Noodles (with Tofu & Veggies) we're delicious! They had the perfect balance of sweet and savory. However the Pad Thai was okay relative to the other food. As vegetarians we asked for no fish sauce, however the dish definitely gave off a fishy flavor that was difficult to mask. Other than that, the menu is a little pricey for the portions given!","2022-05-11 05:42:24.173238+00:00"
"Mellow Mushroom","False","True","4","Mellow Mushroom (although a chain) is one of my favorite pizza places in Charlottesville, VA. Their pizzas are all rich in flavor and have some of the coolest specialty pies I've ever seen. The crust is nice and crispy while retaining a fluffy and airy interior.

My favorite pies include: the Loaded Potato Pie, Cosmic Karma, and the Holy Shiitake.

Although discontinued, you can ask for the Loaded Potato Pie by asking for the following: ""Olive oil and garlic base with roasted red potatoes, jalapeños (subbed from the bacon since I'm vegetarian), caramelized onions, cheddar and mozzarella, chives, drizzle of sour cream & spicy ranch (add a drizzle of Buffalo if you want a kick).""

The Cosmic Karma is vegan and the Holy Shiitake is probably one of the best mushroom pies I've ever had!","2022-05-11 05:38:33.037405+00:00"
"The Well Dressed Burrito","False","True","3","The Well Dressed Burrito is a dope burrito/mexican spot hidden away in the ally's of DC. The menu is a little overwhelming and confusing so just ask them to explain it! 

We ordered the grilled burritos, chips, queso, and guac! The burrito was A LOT and had a good combination of flavors but nothing stood out. It was a flour tortilla with lettuce, tomato, zucchini, squash, pico de gallo, cauliflower, onion, rice, sour cream, guacamole, black beans, and hot sauce. The spot is perfect for vegetarians, since you can modify anything on their menu. It wasn't ground breaking or anything like that, but still a solid meal.

But to be honest, it was the guac that stole the show! It was super fresh and lemony making for the perfect addition to the burrito. The flavors really enhanced the rest of the meal especially when coupled with the hot sauce.

The queso was slightly above average. The chile and onions enhance the flavor but again nothing crazy.

Pro tip: get guac inside your burrito! You can thank me later.","2022-05-10 16:20:14.792128+00:00"
"Torchy's Tacos","False","True","5","My first every Torchy's experience was here in Richardson, TX and my life changed forever!

I highly recommend their Green Chile Queso and Chips, it is easily the best queso I've ever had. The guacamole center in the melted cheese and hot sauce is a chef's kiss. Pro tip, as for some extra Diablo sauce on the side to help give it a bigger kick if you like spicy! Torchy's queso and hot sauces really are secret to their success.

Relative to the queso, the tacos are good but nothing amazing. My favorite tacos however are the Fried Avocado but made trashy with Diablo AND Poblano sauce. The flavors enrich each other for the perfect meal. My next goal is to eat through the entire taco menu, replacing any meats with either fried avocado, eggs, or beans since I'm vegetarian. Im hoping to find a new favorite taco soon!

I HIGHLY recommend Torchy's Tacos to anyone visiting the Dallas area. Will definitely be making multiple repeat trips!","2022-05-11 05:10:24.882743+00:00"
"Rockstar Bagels","False","True","4","My friend from Austin will die on the hill that Bodo’s Bagels in Charlottesville is the GOAT bagel spot, but still fell in love with Rockstar!

I tried an everything bagel with plain cream cheese for a classic taste test. Rockstar Bagels might not be #1 but they still delivered a solid bagel. The bagel was super flavorful from the water and seasonings and came super soft and fluffy. The cream cheese was normal and complemented the bagel well. Overall it was above your average bagel shop. 🥯⭐️","2022-07-08 15:45:34.612653+00:00"
