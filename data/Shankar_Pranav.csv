"Excellent Dumpling House","False","True","4","The dumplings are solid, but everything else on the menu is pretty mediocre to tasteless. Noodle soup is totally useless, stick with the dumplings.","2022-04-09 13:28:07.019443+00:00"
"Dominique Ansel Workshop","False","True","4","Breakfast sandwich was good but a tad oily for my taste. Chai latte was no bueno.","2022-04-10 17:41:18.480407+00:00"
"Margon","False","True","3","Got the bowl with mixed rice, red beans and beef. Was middle of the road Cuban food, nothing to write home about. Portion sizes are massive and it’s a little hole in the wall place with a cafeteria style serving. The Cuban sandwiches looked incredible, will have to try if I make it back.","2022-04-10 13:46:48.718333+00:00"
"Soothr Thai Noodle Bar","False","True","3","Got the duck noodles and Thai iced tea. Both were middle of the road, and portion sizes were on the smaller side. Pretty decent Thai place but nothing super special ","2022-05-20 18:43:58.522372+00:00"
"The Waverly Inn And Garden","False","True","2","Extremely rich American food. Pretty run of the mill menu, butter as a vector for all taste. Quite expensive and not really an enjoyable meal either. The biscuits given free at the beginning were the lone upside.","2022-04-09 13:25:53.007321+00:00"
"Patent Pending","False","True","5","Creative drinks, bartenders and staff are nice, menu is beautifully decorated and am ambiance is really cool. Only downside is the line you have to wait in usually, but well worth it.","2022-04-09 13:35:56.618774+00:00"
"Tomi Jazz","False","True","5","One of my favorite spots in the city. The live jazz is great and the ambiance is incredible. Cool Japanese beer/whiskey/sake selection and the food is pretty solid. Only downside is you usually have to stand in line for an hour to get in, but still easily worth it","2022-04-12 16:50:36.252059+00:00"
"Noreetuh","False","True","3","Cute interior, bit loud, food was slow to come but the staff was incredibly nice. The food itself was a bit underwhelming (mostly it just lacked flavor). Had the chicken loco moco (gravy needed at the very least more salt) and the spicy salmon tartare musubi (very mid).","2022-05-13 03:03:28.992789+00:00"
"L'Artusi","False","True","5","Had the spaghetti which came recommended as a sleeper (was indeed excellent). Olive oil cake was good as well though likely enjoyed more deeply by someone with a sweet tooth. Pleasant, comfy ambiance.","2022-05-09 14:47:55.202188+00:00"
"Miss Ada","False","True","5","Incredible Israeli food. Got the whipped ricotta with honey (perfectly fluffy with a fresh taste, lightly sweet), the falafel (moist and dipped in an incredible green sauce), and the shakshuka (good, but not as good as the other two).","2022-05-23 15:10:34.065466+00:00"
"Craft + Carry","False","True","5","Great beer bar, casual vibes, perfect place for an afternoon catch-up with some friends. Beer was excellent, they had a pale ale that was among the best I’ve had, and bartenders are pretty good at pinpointing what you’ll enjoy.","2022-04-10 13:48:19.277958+00:00"
"Junoon","False","True","5","Never disappoints, still my favorite Indian spot in NYC. Had the tuna puchka (ceviche x pani puri), the new paneer main, the junoon spiced naan (unreasonably good), and the kulfi pops with a masala whiskey to drink. Everything about this place is incredible (bit pricey but worth)","2022-05-09 14:57:23.423784+00:00"
"Izakaya Juraku","False","True","3","Pretty empty when I went but maybe just went at the wrong time. The food was middle of the road (got the curry) but the Japanese beer selection is huge. Wasn’t a huge fan of the two beers I had (forget which ones) but I’m sure there’s something here I’d like ","2022-05-06 20:09:15.109197+00:00"
"Yakiniku Futago NYC","False","True","5","Really solid Japanese bbq, great ambience inside. The kalbi dishes (traditional and dragon) were incredible — melted on your tongue, vibrantly seasoned. The rest of the meat dishes were solid; another standout was the fried chicken. ","2022-05-23 15:13:47.800614+00:00"
"Village Square Pizza","False","True","4","The grandma slice was quite good, albeit on the pricier side. Regular cheese slice was oily and underwhelming. ","2022-05-23 15:08:29.556288+00:00"
"TabeTomo","False","True","2","The ramen broth was so fatty you could see the globules floating in it, and was very mediocre tasting. The noodles were nothing to write home about, and were a bit too thick for my preferences. ","2022-05-09 15:00:45.631872+00:00"
"Cote","False","True","5","Had the Butchers Feast, meat was excellent, side dishes were good but underwhelming by comparison. The Paella was solid, definitely going to go for the Omakase next time","2022-05-06 20:06:54.736908+00:00"
"Madame Vo","False","True","4","Had the Madam Pho, the Bahn Bot Chien and the Vietnamese Coffee. The pho was solid (would be great hangover/cold recovery), the bahn not chien was exceptional, and the Vietnamese coffee was strong but not amazing. Solid Viet place","2022-04-10 13:44:41.223698+00:00"
"Chito Gvrito","False","True","2","Georgian restaurant but really bland food overall. Got the khachapuri with beans and the lamb dumplings. Both were under seasoned. Service was insanely slow, took an hour to get my food from the time I ordered.","2022-05-20 18:45:33.681607+00:00"
"El Born","False","True","4","Solid tapas joint, the squid ink paella was the best thing they had. $35 bottomless also a steal for the quality of food","2022-05-06 20:07:46.475923+00:00"
