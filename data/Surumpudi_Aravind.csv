"Meat Project","False","True","5","Originally was supposed to go to “Qui”, but wait was too long and was recommended to go to meat project by one of the servers. Great Korean bbq and plenty of options. No wait time cus this place is relatively new, and they had plenty of tables. Great food and a great place to eat with a large group of friends. 9.5/10 kbbq ","2022-06-25 20:04:49.520508+00:00"
"Farmtruck Pizza & Greens","False","True","5","Best pizza I’ve had in Virginia. The devils wing pizza was out of this world, and the wild shroom pizza that my parents ordered was also fantastic. Great take out or dine-in spot","2022-06-10 20:14:22.333642+00:00"
