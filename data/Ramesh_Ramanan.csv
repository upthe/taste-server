"Iron Ice","False","True","3","Place used to be great when they served their waffle-ice cream combo the traditional way but because of COVID, they made all orders into takeout. Flavor combos were interesting and well-done.","2022-06-21 02:35:09.351862+00:00"
"Ocha Thai Kitchen & Cafe","False","True","5","Ocha is the best Thai place in the Centreville/Chantilly area. Top 5 Thai places in Nova.

Place always hits with great foundation of traditional Thai food, street food, and phenomenal drinks. Would take 10+ trips to come close to trying all of the menu. Sit in the restaurant if you can, but ocha is still fantastic for takeout.","2022-06-22 02:01:22.159587+00:00"
"Tony's NY Pizza","False","True","4","The different flavors of slices they have are absolutely delicious, try to eat at the restaurant tho. Doesn't translate to good takeout. Place is run by the same family for years, they really care about the customers and the food they make.

Top 10, maybe top 5 best pizza places in nova hands down","2022-06-22 01:51:32.993589+00:00"
"The Qui Korean Grille","False","True","5","Best KBBQ in Centreville, tons of options and the honey butter masala chicken was 💯💯💯💯","2022-06-21 02:31:17.841580+00:00"
"Lebanese Kitchen","False","True","5","Place always hits, mad cheap shawarma wraps for good quality. They have more options than just chicken/beef/falafel wraps so very refreshing to see and try. Would def recommend anyone in the area craving for cheap shawarma","2022-06-22 01:53:46.811357+00:00"
"Thai Tyme","False","True","3","Food was very mediocre. Tastes fine not too bad but if you get any noodle or curry dishes, they'll skimp out on the actual noodle or curry part. Ordered drunken noodles w tofu, looked like they gave us tofu stirfry with 1 singular noodle cut in half 😂 

Not bad, but outshadowed by other Thai places in the area (Ocha Thai, Supreme Thai, etc.)","2022-06-22 01:59:03.362290+00:00"
"Pueblos Tex Mex Grill","False","True","3","Food wasn't too bad. There are better Mexican restaurants in the area but the happy hour menu is 💯. If you're in the area and you're craving cheap margs, this place got you.","2022-06-22 16:01:37.329005+00:00"
"Château de Chantilly","False","True","4","Place is nice, go during the day since the pastries are constantly swapped for freshly made ones. Also its always packed and tough to find spots so 💀💀","2022-06-22 15:57:53.340553+00:00"
"Mama Tigre","False","True","5","Not thr first Indo-Mex fusion but they do it well. Most of the food options are decent if not great. This place is always popping so be prepared to wait but it's usually worth it (reasonably😂). Happy hour is good, and the specials each day are nice.

"Sō Korean Barbeque","False","True","5","Top 3 KBBQ places in nova. Flavors are traditional, servers are great and constantly help you out, and the drinks are bangers. You won't ever regret going to Sō.","2022-06-22 15:59:34.269945+00:00"
