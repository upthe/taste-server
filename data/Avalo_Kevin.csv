"Colombians Place","False","True","3","The workers were amazing and very nice. The ambiance is pretty cool bc it was a foodhall. The food is what kept me from giving it a higher rating. I got the bandeja paisa and felt that the rice and beans were lacking flavor. The chorizo was not hitting, but the plantain was bomb. I would go again but to try the arepas.","2022-06-02 21:44:52.492343+00:00"
