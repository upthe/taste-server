"Hazie's","False","True","4","This went from 3 to 4 because I can‚Äôt stop thinking about their burger - it‚Äôs topped with Brie and wrapped in a brioche bun, really melts in your mouth. The rest of the food and the drinks were also good but nothing special. ","2022-08-27 01:04:57.631737+00:00"
"Norcina","False","True","5","Got a seat at the bar overlooking freshly made pizza going into the wood fire oven- 10/10 views.
Fresh ingredients on their pizza and pasta. My only regret is that I didn‚Äôt get to try a pork/ boar dish which is the chefs specialty, and the reason for the name ‚ÄòNorcina‚Äô.","2022-04-04 17:55:31.879696+00:00"
"Fourn√©e Bakery","False","True","5","Oh so good. Ham and cheese croissant was excellent, all their sweet pastries were perfect. There was a bit of a line, thankfully we got there early.","2022-04-11 19:24:01.217823+00:00"
"Nari","False","True","5","The food was excellent, every single dish was vibrant and creative. I seriously can‚Äôt stop thinking about the pandan parfait that we had for dessert‚Ä¶ Thanks to @Rohan for making the reservation :) I‚Äôll also be going back to try the $100 chefs tasting.","2022-04-04 18:00:23.183707+00:00"
"Dominique Ansel Bakery","False","True","5","Agreed with @Gita, the time of day matters. Everything I‚Äôve tried has been great and worth the hype (cronut, s‚Äômores, eclair, cookie shot, Madeline, milk bread). The only thing that usually prevents me from going there is the line. ","2022-04-29 15:28:16.825237+00:00"
"PURE Thai Cookhouse","False","True","5","Go to place for their dry noodles and pad kra prow (basil work stir fry), a neighborhood favorite!","2022-04-04 20:25:43.367878+00:00"
"The Lavaux Wine Bar","False","True","5","The Swiss fondue is SO good, also loved their salad and foie gras. The wine pairings also hit the spot. Only regret is that I didn‚Äôt save enough room for their chocolate mousse! Service was excellent.

This is a great date night spot, the ambiance is candlelit, romantic and they have cozy gondolas for two.","2022-05-03 21:39:39.634660+00:00"
"TK Noodle House Kona","False","True","3","Didn‚Äôt end up ordering our top choice (Oxtail udon) bc they were out of stock‚Ä¶ the Singaporean udon was promising but nothing special.","2022-09-04 08:17:09.133542+00:00"
"Soupchu","False","True","5","Yum lunch (see Sumac review)","2022-06-20 21:45:42.111889+00:00"
"La Ciccia","False","True","5","Sardinian / southern Italian food in a cozy restaurant, a bit of a hidden gem. The crowd is usually ppl over 40. They have an extensive wine list and pasta is some of the best in SF (not stuff that you can easily make at home).","2022-04-04 20:43:50.967684+00:00"
"Hot Sauce And Panko To Go","False","True","4","Solid wings, lots of great flavors to choose from. The ‚Äúsoggy (in a good way) waffle‚Äù was a gamble- I can vouch that the name is accurate. ","2022-07-07 04:29:23.532393+00:00"
"Good Good Culture Club","False","True","4","Slightly above a 4.
Creative food, vibrant atmosphere, friendly staff. Even though it‚Äôs a tapas style menu, each item was substantial, four dishes was plenty of food for two people. 

Standout dishes for me were the beef carpaccio and the ribs. Shrimp was pretty good. Mango mocktail was tasty and refreshing. I didn‚Äôt feel strongly about the rice ball dish and probably wouldn‚Äôt order it again. Pleasant surprise!","2022-07-07 03:10:51.518053+00:00"
"Birch & Rye","False","True","3","2.5‚Ä¶ I wanted to like it! There was an attempt to deconstruct and elevate dishes that worked in some of the courses but not most. I‚Äôve had cheap Russian food that was incredibly delicious and this just wasn‚Äôt worth $150 per person ü´£","2022-07-11 04:03:48.808419+00:00"
"Empress by Boon","False","True","3","Not a great place for vegetarians. Dessert is pretty but weird, drinks are not well balanced. The food itself was pretty good (some awesome dishes mixed with some good Chinese dishes) and the setting is quite beautiful. 

We did some quick math and it was ~$40 per person for the food. Which IS worth it imo! With drinks and dessert the number was closer to $87 per person, which was NOT worth it. 

I would go again to eat the food then grab a drink at Mr. Jius bar afterwards instead of wasting money. ","2022-06-20 21:43:19.053813+00:00"
"Polite Provisions","False","True","5","Such a great bar, a couple of different rooms with individual drink menus. Mainly spent time at the back whiskey speakeasy area, the drinks we tried were excellent. Would def go back! ","2022-05-31 23:31:36.050145+00:00"
"Sanraku","False","True","5","Affordable and authentic. Everything was fresh and no reservations required bc the space is huge. Nice to finally have a staple for sushi cravings that isn‚Äôt fancy / expensive! Expect a no frills place if u decide to go.","2022-06-20 21:35:59.760905+00:00"
"Two Ladies Kitchen","False","True","5","Waited for 45 mins for the mochi bc they forgot to call my name‚Ä¶ HOWEVER all was forgotten once I started eating the mochi. 
Favs: Butter (mochi cake), shisho, lilikoi, strawberry shortcake
Nothing special/ get something else: mandarin (it was just two pieces of mandarin wrapped with mochi) & all of their ‚Äúfresh fruit‚Äù section is similar","2022-09-04 08:10:02.031185+00:00"
"KITCHEN ISTANBUL","False","True","5","Casual but stylish restaurant/ wine bar. Clean plates- every single dish including dessert. The server had a great recommendation for wine (from an extensive wine list). Would highly recommend!","2022-04-11 19:08:33.011332+00:00"
"Bar Iris","False","True","5","All the cocktails are balanced, unique and aesthetic. Ambiance is nice. Food is not worth it though! ","2022-08-10 16:19:16.838738+00:00"
"Papa Kona Restaurant & Bar","False","True","3","Nice views, breakfast was solid. If you get the pancakes get it with coconut instead of maple syrup. ","2022-09-04 08:14:02.755655+00:00"
"Flores","False","True","4","Great vibes & good food (I liked the fish tacos, chilaquiles). Worth checking out if you‚Äôre in the Marina!","2022-04-04 17:47:17.234400+00:00"
"Moya","False","True","4","Portions were big (I ate this stuff for 3 meals straight) they had a lot of veggie options and nothing felt too heavy or oily‚Ä¶ the beef was kinda salty, but still tasty. 

I gotta go back to Club Waziema and determine which Ethiopian place is better now‚Ä¶","2022-07-27 05:47:40.904295+00:00"
"Liberty Bagels","False","True","5","Super off the radar, I was pleasantly surprised by their chewy bagels with a huge selection of cream cheese. Get them untoasted if you‚Äôre trying them for the first time!","2022-04-04 20:34:42.480965+00:00"
"Dhamaka","False","True","5","Some of the best Indian food I‚Äôve had in the US as a bonus our server was attentive and energetic! The rabbit was a spectacular experience (they only make one a day, so order in advanced) the goat biriyani was very flavorful. This place does not hold back on spiciness though ü•µ","2022-04-04 17:37:46.871912+00:00"
"Sanraku","False","True","4","This is the place I keep going back to for sushi lately. To make keep it short- no frills, super fresh fish/ authentic sushi. More like a 4.5 in my book. ","2022-08-02 22:01:48.337919+00:00"
"Honua's Coffee House","False","True","4","Very cute local coffee shop for a pit stop! Got a guava mango matcha smoothie (in addition to an iced coffee) that was so delicious. ","2022-09-04 08:21:50.064991+00:00"

"Viks Chaat","False","True","4","Chaat and choley hit the spot ‚Ä¶ dosa was disappointing; oily with very little filling","2022-04-11 19:28:20.347052+00:00"
"10 Butchers Korean BBQ","False","True","5","Hidden gem- one of the best KBBQ places I‚Äôve ever been. Every cut of meat was excellent and the banchan was delicious. Their staff was incredible and the attention to detail + food made it well worth the price ","2022-05-06 19:05:17.012204+00:00"
"Cote","False","True","4","Omakase was more than worth it and the drinks were good. It took forever (almost an hour past our reservation time) for them to set up our table but when they finally seated us the service and some excellent caviar made up for it! 

Note: If you‚Äôre in the Bay Area I‚Äôd recommend trying 10 butchers for high end KBBQ, I think their cuts are excellent, service is insane and it‚Äôs a much less chaotic atmosphere than Cote.","2022-05-06 19:00:11.094269+00:00"
"Camino Alto","False","True","4","Good vibes. The Japanese sweet potato tacos are a hit, the coffee is tasty. Will be back!","2022-08-21 17:59:52.017673+00:00"
"Sottocasa Pizzeria - Harlem","False","True","5","New favorite pizza place in Manhattan. 
Pizza: soupy, thin sourdough crusted, charred perfectly fresh out of the oven‚Ä¶ worth the trip all the way uptown!","2022-04-04 20:24:04.491665+00:00"
"The Tyger","False","True","3","Cool space and ambiance, food was tasty but nothing spectacular and a bit on the oily side. Drinks were overly sweet. ","2022-04-29 15:15:34.719234+00:00"
"Big Island Brewhaus","False","True","1","Menu looks good but everything is way too greasy. It‚Äôs unfortunate that we gave into hunger and ate here instead of waiting for dinner spots to open up. I would actively urge ppl to not get any if their food‚Ä¶ The beer was ok‚Ä¶","2022-09-04 08:02:23.519379+00:00"
"Kopitiam","False","True","4","Solid Malaysian flavors, super hard to find a spot that nails this cuisine. The Kya toast is a must order, simple but delicious. ","2022-04-29 15:17:13.288449+00:00"
"Palette Tea House","False","True","5","The truffle fried rice is worth it. ","2022-07-11 03:58:39.587299+00:00"
"Zen Yai","False","True","5","Favorite Thai in SF, boat noodles are excellent. They don‚Äôt mess around with spiciness though. Medium is spicy here!","2022-06-09 04:16:45.326229+00:00"
"Lion Dance Cafe","False","True","3","I mean‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs hype and I get why
- there aren‚Äôt very many Singaporean vegan places 
- the location is hip and everyone that eats there has a tattoo
- they change the menu depending on the day/ week and it‚Äôs exciting to try all the new things
But‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs because @lalli and I don‚Äôt have tattoos or that we both went out of our way to try this place but it was only meh (imo)
Possible reasons:
- it‚Äôs a takeout only place with a small space to sit and eat outside, by the time we ate our food it was kind of cold
- we got one item that was really good/ interesting (mushroom goreng- creative and flavorful) and two that were only ok (jackfruit rendang- jackfruit was super fibrous and laksa- got soggy and didn‚Äôt have enough flavor) 

Still not entirely sure how to rate it numerically but it‚Äôs a shrug ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è compared to how well it‚Äôs rated everywhere and how busy it gets","2022-05-31 23:12:38.278434+00:00"
"Shabu Sen","False","True","5","4.5, a little pricey. Authentic Japanese hot pot place with quality ingredients. Split one course between two people‚Ä¶ 

Shabu Shabu was mild but tasty, the sukiyaki was a bit on the sweeter side (pic of the cotton candy that melts into the broth). After the hot pot they give you ramen (with actually al dente noodles and authentic broth) AND a dessert ice cream so you‚Äôll leave very satisfied. ","2022-07-11 03:56:42.010675+00:00"
"Daeho","False","True","5","This place worth the hype- incredible preparation of beef and their broth is amazing. If you don‚Äôt want to stand in line, it delivers very well!","2022-04-04 17:43:10.112998+00:00"
"Raku","False","True","4","I‚Äôm leaning toward a 4.5! The udon was very very good, great texture and flavor. I would go back and try a cold noodle. ","2022-04-29 15:32:07.050809+00:00"
"The Blond","False","True","4","The bouncers can be douchy (just like any higher end NY lounge) but once you get past that around midnight the music is poppin and the crowd is usually good here","2022-04-29 15:22:12.016304+00:00"
"Caf√© Leon Dore","False","True","4","Iced cappuccino fredo is the move, it‚Äôs a Greek style coffee with lots of foam. I thought this place would be just about aesthetics but the coffee and cookies surprised me!","2022-04-29 15:25:03.553699+00:00"
"Nelore Grill Brazilian Kitchen","False","True","5","Formerly known as rice and beans‚Äî some of the best beans I‚Äôve ever had. No frills menu, definition of comfort food. 

+ their steak is good - the empanadas lack flavor","2022-04-04 20:30:10.674536+00:00"
"Kanaka Kava","False","True","4","Great way to get into the aloha island vibes after a flight. 

While I don‚Äôt like the earthy taste of kava by itself, I tried the kava with juice and it was pretty good + had a mellowing effect. The Hawaiian platter was traditional and worth the unique palette experience (personally wouldn‚Äôt seek the food out again though)","2022-09-04 08:33:28.877417+00:00"
"Serafina","False","True","4","Hidden gem with great views of the bridge - had a lovely dinner here the other night.

"Bottega","False","True","5","Scrumptious pasta (I keep thinking about the bolognese) in beautiful, upscale setting. Service was slow but the bread baskets were so good that the wait was not a problem. Skip the tiramisu.","2022-08-02 22:07:03.423403+00:00"
"Palette Tea House","False","True","4","Definitely try: custard dumplings, fried har gao

Elevated dim sum place, good ambiance and unique for the Ghirardelli square area. Would come back with a large group!","2022-04-16 01:36:21.535550+00:00"
"Sumac","False","True","5","Fav lunch place so far. Lots of options and everything is flavorful (even the rice) / nourishing for a weekday pick-me-up.

"Curry Leaf","False","True","4","Tried the keema biriyani bc of @anjani‚Äôs review- it was very good, the chicken tikka masala was also very flavorful, the naan was miss (but we had paratha at home so it wasn‚Äôt too annoying) and the palak paneer is good but not mind blowing. Overall I think this place is pretty solid!","2022-06-14 04:23:04.620543+00:00"
"Za Pizza","False","True","3","It‚Äôs a New York style pizza but disappointing after trying some amazing pizza in New York‚Ä¶ the staff is very nice and I think it‚Äôs a good slice after a night out but nothing special!","2022-06-14 04:49:16.834432+00:00"
"BONDST","False","True","3","Used to be my favorite special occasion place‚Ä¶ things have changed since it became trendy

 + high quality raw fish, it‚Äôs a cozy vibey place with good drinks (saw AOC eating there the last time)
- kind of cramped even with a reservation, service has been off putting 2x in a row

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a good place for a drink and some sushi at the bar, but Nobu is a better experience if you want vibey high end sushi ","2022-04-04 20:53:47.509426+00:00"
"reception","False","True","4","Excellent unique drinks- all soju based. Cute setting but pretty damn crowded on a Friday night. The service was not great, likely because of how busy it was. ","2022-04-29 15:19:37.938085+00:00"
"On The Bridge Restaurant","False","True","5","Stumbled into this fun little Japanese diner with @deena for Japanese Curry. Turns out, they have a HUGE menu and many kinds of Japanese spaghetti (didn‚Äôt know this was a thing).
