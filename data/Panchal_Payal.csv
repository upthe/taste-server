"North Lime Coffee & Donuts","False","True","5","Really cute coffee shop! Just moved here and the staff was super welcoming and even gave me a free donut - blueberry with strawberry glaze! They are best known for their plain glazed and have neat drinks of the week. Very flavorful cold brew as well, will be back soon :) ","2022-07-04 16:17:09.971271+00:00"
"The Liberty Tavern","False","True","5","Went to their unlimited small plates brunch, and for an extra 15 bucks you can add on unlimited drinks! Large variety of small plates! The pair of biscuits and butter and their spinach artichoke dip was amazing. Then for dessert, they switch off every week and do a small cute trio of pastries! Totally recommend and it’s located in a convenient place too, lots of fun shops around :) ","2022-05-22 13:03:47.512842+00:00"
"Oscar Wilde","False","True","4","Great Parmesan truffle fries to share with friends! Their wings are okay, nothing special but Oscar wilde is known for their drinks. I got a pomegranate margarita and devoured it! Super cute place with a great, quaint ambiance! ","2022-06-20 23:51:52.571079+00:00"
"Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams","False","True","5","Got a small scoop of the gooey butter cake, had to go in and get more! For sure a neat ice cream place for people who like to be adventurous. They even had banana pudding ice cream (also great). Will be back!  ","2022-06-04 03:12:37.514745+00:00"
"Urth Caffé","False","True","5","The cutest cafe in LA! I visited Urth when I first visited LA a few years back and I had their poached egg avocado toast. This time around I got their signature granita frozen coffee and their huevos rancheros breakfast burrito - bomb. The place does not disappoint! ","2022-06-25 18:12:40.461430+00:00"
"Carlo's Bake Shop","False","True","4","Had to stop by as I grew up watching Buddy on cake boss! The cupcakes were def too sweet but 10/10 for the lobster tail and cannolis. The cake slices taste like your average run of the mill grocery store cakes but this isn’t the Hoboken shop which is the OG, this one’s the one in the city so maybe it’s better in Hoboken! Pretty good tho! ","2022-06-20 23:48:00.181148+00:00"
"Great White - Venice Beach","False","True","5","The BEST truffle pizza in LA! A little bit on the pricier side but totally worth it. They also have amazing polenta fries and a cute ambience - half indoor and half outdoor seating. Great service too! ","2022-06-29 15:34:47.488129+00:00"
"Chuy's","False","True","5","Has been a family favorite for a while now! Excellent creamy jalapeño sauce that goes with all their dishes. Delicious piña coladas that are blended very well! If you’re looking for typical Tex-mex with extra cheesiness this is the place to go! Amazing starter chips as well. ","2022-05-19 02:25:36.408568+00:00"
"Velocity Wings","False","True","1","No. ","2022-06-14 19:11:45.554795+00:00"
"Nick the Greek","False","True","5","AMAZING GYROS! I got the pork belly one and it was to die for! My friends and I went back for seconds. They also have delicious Nick fries that come with their in house secret gyro sauce! A must go to for any Greek food lovers and on the cheaper side compared to other places in Santa Monica!","2022-06-29 20:02:45.477525+00:00"
