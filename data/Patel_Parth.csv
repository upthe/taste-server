"Tida Thai Cuisine","False","True","3","It’s basic Thai food, nothing super special here but it gets the job done. ","2022-05-17 10:30:12.880521+00:00"
"Matchbox - Reston Station","False","True","4","Pizza is fantastic! Got the spinach and artichoke dip as well and it was meh","2022-05-14 02:23:58.314703+00:00"
"Toast","False","True","5","Award winning vegetarian chili with fantastic fresh bread. This place is definitely worth trying and you should absolutely get one of their bowls!","2022-05-17 10:29:02.902607+00:00"
"The Bee & The Biscuit","False","True","5","I would rate this place six stars if I could. I have yet to come across another brunch place in any other city I’ve gone to that matches this! Definitely try out the hen party omelet! The only stipulation is that you need to get there as close to opening as you can. If you try to get the past 9 or 10, there’s usually already a ~2-3 hour wait.","2022-05-14 10:32:43.284863+00:00"
"Pho 79","False","True","2","Flavor was super bland. Great reviews on google but tbh I think those people don’t know what real pho tastes like","2022-05-14 02:15:44.893581+00:00"
"Strawberry Fields","False","True","5","Excellent gelato that is handmade everyday with constantly rotating, seasonal flavors. Definitely check out their insta before going to see what flavors are available! ","2022-05-17 00:09:51.419302+00:00"
"Cook Out","False","True","3","Milkshake is more akin to ice cream and it tastes v syrupy. Chicken sandwich isn’t much better. The redeeming quality is that the milkshakes have a texture which is good for dipping fries in if you’re into that sort of thing","2022-05-14 22:55:10.311048+00:00"
"Social Burger","False","True","5","Very solid fast casual burger place. I got the vfc with ghost pepper jack and Thai mayo while @Priyanka got the imposter. Standout was definitely the house made pickles. Excellent crispy pickles without being overpowering. Got a regular fries to split with @Priyanka and it was enough to feed the entire Addams family. Highly recommend for a fast casual burger! ","2022-06-03 22:03:18.299529+00:00"
"The Yard Milkshake Bar, Inc.","False","True","3","I’m sure Priya will disagree w me but this place falls into the instagram trap in which every new restaurant is just trying to make something so over the top that looks amazing online but falls flat in reality. The milkshake itself is good and that’s kind of where the praises end. The yard is known for being a place with milkshakes with decadent toppings but the toppings are so poorly done. For instance, when Priyanka and I went, we ordered a s’mores milkshake and there was a chocolate coated s’more on top. We’re both the kind of people that save the best bite for the end so we were super disappointed when we bit into the s’more and realized that they hadn’t toasted it at all. The best part of the s’more is the melted chocolate and gooey marshmallow… Other toppings were similarly meh and dropped the experience from what could have been five stars to three ","2022-05-17 10:43:21.230911+00:00"
"Simply Social Coffee - Vienna","False","True","5","Was considering giving this place four stars because of its meh coffee but honestly, the chipotle chicken sandwich is so good that I had to rate this place a 5. Definitely give this a shot!","2022-05-19 15:19:48.987480+00:00"
"Caffè Amouri","False","True","5","Incredible lattes. Relatively lighter roast makes for a more delicate cup with less bitterness","2022-05-14 02:17:16.892241+00:00"
"Leone's Italian","False","True","4","Great ambiance with an excellent outdoor seating section. Chicken Marsala is excellent but other dishes that I have tried are only ok","2022-05-15 13:38:15.223196+00:00"
"Plaza Azteca","False","True","3","It’s Mexican food. Nothing super special","2022-05-14 02:21:26.296646+00:00"
"Granby Waffle Shop","False","True","3","I was so excited about this place but what a let down. The waffles were fine but the toppings were just so over the top that it just felt excessive. They tried to be creative with a few dishes but they just didn’t really hit the mark with weird combinations that don’t work super well together. I’d pass on this.","2022-05-17 10:34:27.008727+00:00"
"Judy's Sichuan Cuisine","False","True","5","Authentic sichuan Chinese food ","2022-05-14 02:12:25.766639+00:00"
"Alkaline","False","True","5","Unique ramen dishes. Red curry ramen is excellent","2022-05-14 02:16:20.923097+00:00"
"Taste Unlimited","False","True","5","Excellent sandwiches. One of the few places where I would wholeheartedly recommend their multigrain bread ","2022-05-14 02:26:20.465427+00:00"
"Heirloom","False","True","5","Another place I would wholeheartedly recommend. Southern food but so elevated. The fried chicken has an amazing crunch while still remaining insanely juicy and tender with a subtle sweetness. Perfectly seasoned for all courses. 

Only cons: drinks are a little too strong imo (maybe not really a con), and it’s a little more expensive but so worth it","2022-05-15 13:36:46.121371+00:00"
"Doumar's Cones and Barbecue","False","True","5","Home of the first waffle cone! Some great American classic ice creams","2022-05-14 02:22:30.294784+00:00"
"The Grilled Cheese Bistro","False","True","3","Way too much. First few bites are great and then you sort of just feel gross eating more","2022-05-14 02:20:43.606072+00:00"
"Taco Bamba","False","True","5","Great vegetarian options! These tacos are amazing! Definitely try the mushroom taco! Also got the chicken tinga nachos and they were pretty good as well!","2022-05-26 11:58:55.058562+00:00"
"Repeal Bourbon and burgers","False","True","5","This is one of those places that makes me wish this app had a sixth star. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Amazing burger creations with the ability to substitute an excellent beyond patty into any burger. Right on the ocean front too so head to the beach either before or after dinner or have some funnel cake at the pizza place right next door! ","2022-06-03 22:10:32.438259+00:00"
"Noodle Man","False","True","4","Hand pulled noodles are excellent. Flavors could be a bit deeper","2022-05-14 02:13:12.102056+00:00"
