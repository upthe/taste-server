"Dhamaka","False","True","4","Really unique menu for an Indian place - think it tries to bring forward many traditional and less popular dishes. Came here last year when I still ate meat so I went for the bold move and had the goat testicles and they were honestly pretty decent lol ","2022-05-26 17:34:01.386401+00:00"
"Cotogna","False","True","5","This place is absolutely goated. Pastas out of the world. Super hard to get a res though but 100 percent worth it. Blankets + heaters are a great touch for outdoor dining in often frigid SF. ","2022-05-26 17:43:29.512412+00:00"
"Brooklyn Bagel & Coffee Company","False","True","4","Had an everything bagel with scallion cream cheese. The bagel was seasoned well and had the right amount of crunchiness to it. Prob a top 5 bagel I’ve had in NYC. The oatmeal was pretty average though - the fruit toppings didn’t taste that fresh.   ","2022-06-12 23:03:33.681572+00:00"
"Gupshup","False","True","5","Fire upscale Indian fusion. Highly recommend the jackfruit tacos and the mango lassi (it has a spicy kick to it!!!!!) ","2022-05-26 17:12:15.122087+00:00"
"Somtum Der","False","True","5","Loved the veggie fried rice here. Had the perfect amount of spice and crispiness","2022-06-12 22:59:44.732892+00:00"
"LA Sandwicherie Williamburg","False","True","4","Pretty great open faced French baguette sandwiches. I had the veggie one which was a bunch of grilled veggies w melted Brie (yum!) A little bit lacking in intensity of flavors though. ","2022-06-06 19:03:53.445980+00:00"
"Curry Pizza House","False","True","5","After a long period of deliberating on what to get for dinner, a friend and I narrowed it down to two options: pizza or Indian. ¿Por que no los dos? Did a half and half pizza of chili paneer and curry chicken and we both loved our respective halves. Honestly might become a staple when I’m feeling gluttonous. ","2022-06-28 03:38:28.126376+00:00"
"Ojalá Authentic Mexican","False","True","5","Amazing nachos and veggie burrito - it’s pretty cool they give you four different veg options (cactus, rajas, mushroom, and one that eludes my memory maybe it was zucchini). Only L is that the server messed up and gave my vegetarian friend a meat burrito ","2022-07-06 17:41:07.087913+00:00"
"Thai Holic","False","True","5","Got dinner here tonight and loved it! Fried rice was the perfect amount of spicy and very flavorful. My friend got a noodle dish that was also on point. Great service too! ","2022-07-07 01:42:54.086175+00:00"
"Málà Project","False","True","5","I love Szechuan food and mala has a fire build your own dry pot option. My go to order is rice cake, wood ear mushroom, bok choy, corn, and sweet potato. Only qualm is that it’s probably overpriced but I love the dry spice so much I won’t even knock it down a point. ","2022-05-26 17:19:06.344502+00:00"
"Electric Burrito","False","True","4","Great portobello mushroom burrito! Love the refried beans and the salsa and it’s thick as fuck. Only downside is price - how can a vegetarian burrito with guac cost more than 16 bucks???","2022-05-26 17:05:19.725072+00:00"
"Hangawi","False","True","5","Went here a few years ago and fell in love with the ambiance (I honestly don’t even remember what we ate but I remember having a positive experience). You take your shoes off and sit on the ground! And it’s all vegetarian - what else can a guy ask for? ","2022-05-26 17:15:37.278733+00:00"
"Terra Thai","False","True","3","So I thought this place was pretty good when I first got it because I was high but then I tired it sober and it was pretty meh. Have tried the pad thai and pad kee mao. ","2022-05-26 17:11:22.665436+00:00"
"Impasto","False","True","3","This is my neighborhood pizza joint - bit underwhelming due to the thicker crust and the exorbitant prices (6.50 for most of the special slices) ","2022-07-12 20:50:20.855094+00:00"
"Graziella's","False","True","4","Fun rooftop to eat on. Shared a bottle of wine and had the veg pizza + fried ravioli. Pizza was good, ravioli was meh. ","2022-08-02 21:21:40.492696+00:00"
"Levain Bakery","False","True","4","I LOVE the levain cookies. They’re so fucking thick and juicy. Chocolate walnut is the flagship cookie for a damn good reason. Only L is that they are so big it deters me from getting one. If there was a mini option that was half the size I’d go way more often lol ","2022-05-26 17:30:31.261111+00:00"
"Two Boots","False","True","5","This is my go-to slice spot because it’s half a block from my place. Really cool combo of Cajun + Italian flavors. They have unique dipping sauces too - try the Cajun ranch! ","2022-05-26 17:01:52.996273+00:00"
"Atithi","False","True","5","Absolute fire Indian food. Had the paneer makhani and the malai kofta with an assortment of naan / paratha / roti. ","2022-07-10 13:22:18.564236+00:00"
"Junoon","False","True","4","Had the Junoon chat, paneer, dal makhani, and bread pudding as part of the prix fixe menu. Thought the food was pretty good but not at all worth the price point ($95 base and then with tax and tip up to $130). Highlight of the meal was the bread pudding. ","2022-06-06 19:01:07.038068+00:00"
"Olea Mediterranean Taverna","False","True","5","This is super random, but their yogurt with honey and walnut and fruit compote was otherworldly. ","2022-08-02 21:20:16.960440+00:00"
"Guevara's","False","True","5","Their empanadas are pretty bomb. ","2022-08-02 21:23:12.028211+00:00"
"Sahib Indian Cuisine","False","True","5","Went here once and I was high so that might be inflating my review, but thought it was pretty bomb. Had the malai kofta and dal makhani. They even had an option for chapati / tawa roti! It’s really nice to eat Indian food and not get bloated af from the naan.  ","2022-05-26 17:26:03.511186+00:00"
"Westlight","False","True","5","Spent a summer afternoon here last year sipping on aperol spritzes and taking in the best view of the city from this rooftop. ","2022-05-26 17:38:27.662152+00:00"
"Molly's","False","True","2","Randomly came here for a veggie burger and beer. The burger was pretty dry and flavorless. The beer was fine. ","2022-06-03 01:18:06.114292+00:00"
"Adda Indian Canteen","False","True","5","Lived up to the hype. Pav bhaji, lotus root kofta and paneer do pyaza were all bomb af. Chili paneer was ok. ","2022-07-24 23:14:58.824200+00:00"
"Spicy Moon Vegetarian Szechuan","False","True","5","Got the scallion pancakes and wontons in chili oil for takeout. Both were delicious - I loved the chili oil so much I used the excess as a dip for the pancakes. ","2022-06-12 23:44:13.815183+00:00"
"Mughlai Grill Indian Cuisine","False","True","2","The tikka masala gravy I got straight up tasted like a tomato…","2022-05-26 17:16:59.469547+00:00"
"Vatan Indian Restaurant","False","True","3","Went here for my birthday last year. Pretty unique idk if you can get an AYCE Gujarati thali anywhere else in the city. The apps were pretty solid but the mains were meh. On the plus side they do have good Indian whisky like Amrut and Rampur available. ","2022-05-26 17:13:51.412721+00:00"
"Miss Ada","False","True","5","Went here with pshanks last weekend and tasted transcendence in the ricotta. Super happy I’ll be living a 10 minute walk from this place soon :) ","2022-05-26 17:07:56.008901+00:00"
