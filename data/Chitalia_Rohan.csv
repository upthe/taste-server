"Ichiran - Brooklyn","False","True","4","Ramen was very good and they allow for a lot of customization around the noodles, broth, etc. It also maintains the old Japanese single booth appeal. ","2022-05-19 13:06:22.470252+00:00"
"Rowdy Rooster","False","True","4","Amazing spot. Got for spice level 2 or 3 (if 3, get the mango lassi bottle). The smaller sando likely is snack size and wonâ€™t fill you up for a meal. ","2022-05-19 13:13:28.184805+00:00"
