"Alfa Bagels","False","True","5","I always get the taylor ham egg and cheese on an everything bagel. Everything you want in a bagel sandwich. Pretty far away unless you have a reason to be here tho","2022-04-09 21:21:07.316338+00:00"
"THEP Thai Restaurant","False","True","5","Ignore the super random club EDM music. The food is really good and fast too. Definitely recommend the green curry","2022-04-16 01:07:07.436253+00:00"
"The Casbah - Halal Cart","False","True","5","Go-to near my apartment. Good portions, tasty, and the staff is very friendly :)","2022-08-14 00:26:55.231069+00:00"
"Legend 72","False","True","5","Mapo Tofu and Eggplant with garlic sauce. Amazing super soft texture on both and drowning in sauce to pack it full of flavor. Will go again!","2022-10-07 23:06:50.335366+00:00"
"Tacos Aya Yay","False","True","4","Objectively this place is a 5. Good tortillas, good salsa, good vibes, cheap‚Ä¶. But im a spoiled brat when it comes to tacos, and they were a little dry without salsa. 4/5","2022-05-30 02:15:51.200005+00:00"
"Sahara's NYC","False","True","4","Some of the dishes appear pricy, but the portions are huge (1.5-2 meals for me). Great if you want dinner and leftovers. The kebab is pretty good and comes with a huge piece of bread but the taste doesnt quite wow","2022-04-02 01:20:11.817925+00:00"
"Lalibela Ethiopian Restaurant","False","True","4","Food was probably a low 5, but it took a long time. The veggie sambusas were extremely good, the sampler platter was good but I love Ethiopian food","2022-08-21 23:23:26.209641+00:00"
"Wenwen","False","True","4","Celtuce salad was satisfyingly crunchy and the tangyuan (fried variant with ice cream) was very good. The popcorn chicken was solid, pork belly + cuttlefish was ok but too rich and heavy.

Apparently they are known for their BDSM chicken (it has some other meaning but still wtf?) but it ran out so maybe that‚Äôs the real catch here","2022-04-29 22:33:35.466202+00:00"
"Burrata Pizza","False","True","5","üî•üî•üî• I saw Ani‚Äôs rec and decided to try it. The cheese slice was good but Burrata‚Äôs in the name for a reason. definitely get one of those and put some chili flakes on ü§§","2022-04-23 23:11:07.330533+00:00"
"Fresh2Go","False","True","4","Got a green chile burrito. Tasted amazing and had after a very hot, long day and the portions were large but burrito standards are pretty high and it didn‚Äôt quite reach those levels ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ","2022-09-05 14:03:04.582818+00:00"
"Balade","False","True","3","I‚Äôve been here before and really liked it but this was my first time getting takeout and tried a couple nee things. I got a kafta sandwich and a zataar manakeesh (lebanese pizza). They were fine, just pretty bland. I would go back but I‚Äôd stick to the mezzes I had before","2022-04-23 14:34:21.305508+00:00"
"Bolivian Llama Party","False","True","5","Got a chicken saltena (soupy empanada), sandwich de chola (pork sandwich with pickled veggies), and rellenos (croquettes). All were good but my personal favorite has to be the beef croquettes and all the dipping sauces. Unfortunately it‚Äôs too far from manhattan for me to go regularly :(","2022-04-16 23:30:16.158159+00:00"
"7-Eleven","False","True","5","Too fcking hot. Drank 2 gatorades and damn they were good","2022-09-05 14:04:56.796155+00:00"
"Malay","False","True","4","We got the roti canai, malay char kway teow (pan fried noodles), and rendang (aromatic curry). All were pretty solid, good comfort food with some mild spice. The roti canai was crispy and a very good appetizer. If i have to be critical id say the noodles were a little bland. Worth going back!","2022-04-10 17:13:11.554649+00:00"
"sweetgreen","False","True","3","If you‚Äôre in a pinch and want to eat healthy, there are a number of solid tasting salads. Butttt they‚Äôre way overpriced","2022-04-01 23:44:07.821203+00:00"
"Los Mariscos","False","True","5","The best seafood tacos, hands down. It‚Äôs a sibling restaurant to the better known Los Tacos No 1 but los mariscos is better and has shorter lines. I‚Äôve tried everything on the (small) menu and it‚Äôs all good. Personal fav is the fish ceviche. The vibes inside are even good too!","2022-04-21 00:56:03.116544+00:00"
"Heart of Jerusalem Cafe","False","True","5","I got a gyro with lamb and chicken. The inside was very good but the differentiator is definitely the spices on the pita itself. I definitely havent had that much flavor on a pita. Very good!","2022-05-30 02:11:11.481523+00:00"
"Peaches","False","True","5","I got the fried chicken + french toast. The french toast was breaded with granola but was still completely soft, very nice. Cara liked the jumbo shrimp po-boy too!","2022-08-28 17:53:51.918576+00:00"
"Moab Street Dogs","False","True","5","Fun food trucks surrounded by other food trucks. We got a relatively tame one with pickles potato chips and honey mustard","2022-09-05 14:00:50.326799+00:00"
