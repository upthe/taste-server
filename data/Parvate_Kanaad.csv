"Whitechapelsf","False","True","5","Drinks were one of a kind— it’s a gin bar (and I don’t love gin), but I tried some drinks that tasted like nothing I’ve tried before. Both the Lokono X and the Dover Straight Sling were top notch. Punch was also solid and different. 

Also the bar has a cool mid-century London tube vibe. ","2022-05-31 04:06:38.329911+00:00"
"Cracked & Battered","False","True","5","Owners are super nice, food is excellent and won’t break the bank. Try the shakshuka and hummus or the lemon ricotta pancakes. ","2022-05-24 02:20:02.005217+00:00"
"Young's Kung Fu Action Theatre & Laundry","False","True","5","Vibey af dive bar. In the tenderloin but so worth a visit. It’s like being taken back in time to old SF, complete with kitschy hanging dragons, infinity mirrors, and super cheap drinks ","2022-05-25 00:21:06.100700+00:00"
