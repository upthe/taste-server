"Adel's Famous Halal Food","False","True","5","Had been before but had to go back off Vamsi’s rec.- it’s so good. Get the classic chicken over rice with hot and white sauce, there’s a reason the line stretches far. Well worth the wait, and portion size is enough that you’ll probably have leftovers. ","2022-05-10 13:01:39.415163+00:00"
"Texas Rotisserie & Grill","False","True","4","Got the beef brisket with 2 sides: baked potato and corn. I was surpriiised how much portion sizes were; I expected to be one flank of meat but the entire plate was full of meat. And it was tender and well-flavored, blend of pulled and whole meat. The baked potato was the whole potato, and you can’t really mess up corn. And they threw in a free cornbread too! All relatively cheap as well, great bang for your buck.","2022-06-14 01:54:00.326035+00:00"
"Taco Bell","False","True","5","Even when you’re in the middle of nowhere upstate and it’s 12am, TB comes in clutch and always slaps. 10/10 for consistency.","2022-08-20 16:58:09.064034+00:00"
"Aqua Boil","False","True","1","I thought about giving this 2 stars but I literally couldn’t finish the food. It had a chill ambiance and great staff but bad food is bad food. Lobster felt sour, Crab felt too bitter. Nothing had enough salt but only gave one lemon. And it was waaaay expensive. ","2022-09-02 02:30:16.203387+00:00"
"5 Napkin Burger","False","True","2","Realistically more of a 3 but ive been twice and neither was great, and the last time was particularly weak. Long wait for table for 2, ordered an app at the bar that never came, and table had a spill underneath that I had to ask someone to clean. Prices also feel pretty high, which is par for the course for old American bars, but usually quality of food is better. Got their namesake patty melt and it was fine - pretty greasy and cheese overpowers all other tastes. ","2022-08-23 15:49:33.524476+00:00"
"Mom's Kitchen & Bar","False","True","4","Breakfast burrito was amazing, sweet & savory mix. Red Velvet milkshake was insane, there was a literal cake slice on top of it. Steak was decent, chicken & waffles were good but maple syrup was weirdly spicy. Bit expensive so can’t go often but would definitely go again. Great vibe too, borderline 5 stars.","2022-05-07 19:29:37.832023+00:00"
"Toasties","False","True","1","Gave this a second try for some reason. Wasnt worth it. Got the EZ sandwich - waay too much sauce yet no flavor. Meat and toppings were also pretty flavorless, and the mushrooms were super chewy. I also ordered a protein shake, that’s 3 ingredients: milk, PB, and banana. Very simple, hard to mess up. What they sent me is some green looking monster that reeks of old kale. Def not a shake of any kind. 

Will not be going back for a third try. ","2022-05-23 16:53:04.206613+00:00"
"Grazie Grazie","False","True","4","Breaded chicken sandwich was fire, but hard to pick - lots of artisanal options. Waffle fries were solid. Whole restaurant felt a little overhyped tho, especially considering other options in the Wharf","2022-03-27 00:42:56.699753+00:00"
"V{IV}","False","True","5","After trying a few more Thai places, I think is definitely my go-to. Does Thai the way I like it, and closest I’ve had in NY to the middle school g.o.a.t.: Sense of Thai Ashburn. ","2022-08-23 15:43:48.997236+00:00"
"Sacco Pizza","False","True","4","Some of the best Sicilian pizza I’ve had in NY. The crust was firm but also fluffy so it never felt too heavy. The cheese and sauce were also really flavorful - think the sauce mightve been the MVP, just great pizza sauce, real tomato flavor etc. Im convinced that the way to succeed here is just stick to cheese. ","2022-09-14 12:44:11.981891+00:00"
"Gray's Papaya","False","True","4","Thought about giving it 5 stars. This is a famous hotdog and juice place in NY, used to be known for being late night but seems like stopped post-Covid. One hotdog is like $2 which is phenomenal esp with today’s prices. The relish was perfectly sweet and the hotdog itself was flavorful. Papaya juice was also both creamy and refreshing without being too strong. Gets downgraded to 4 because the chili cheese dog was ok, cheese was tasteless and overpowering, and also hotdog sizes could’ve been bigger. It’s not a costco $1 dog but it feels close. ","2022-09-08 15:03:17.820674+00:00"
"Top Thai Vintage","False","True","4","What was really interesting about this spot is it’s like a “make your own Thai dish”. You choose a classic Thai Base (pad thai, Basil udon, yellow curry, etc.) and then add your meats and other toppings. I got the Basil Udon with Mock Duck. I love thicker noodles and these had a great texture and consistency so you really taste each bite. The Mock Duck is kind of like boneless chicken crisped and seasoned similar to duck, a nice in between (the duck itself isn’t bad either but more expensive). I will say the biggest downside was I ordered mild spicy and this definitely was not, the spice level combined with the temperature being boiling the whole time made it pretty difficult to eat. Honestly tasted better once it had cooled down a few hours later, cuz you can enjoy more flavors. Also portion sizes pretty big, can probably share one or take it home for 2nds. Thai Ice Tea was solid, hard to mess that up. All in all a nice Thai option if you’re ever in the Village. ","2022-07-01 16:22:17.942893+00:00"
"Quality Bistro","False","True","4","Apologies if this comes off like a flex, I assure you id never normally be at a place like this (unless @srikanth  book’s the rezzy). 
With that being said, definitely a great time. Restaurant had great ambiance, nice decor without getting too obnoxious and large windows meant nice natural lighting. Staff were also great, very professional and great recommendations. Got the lobster toast appetizer - delicious; while there was a bit too much butter in the sauce it just hit the spot with the seafood. The crabcakes were also nice, fluffy with a crisp shell. Tuna was a bit too tangy for me. The steak medium-rare was fantastic, not too chewy with just enough flavor. Portion sizes were huge though, nobody could finish. The real MVP was the fried chicken, something about the seasoning just worked perfectly, like a sweet chilli crisp. And the skin just came off perfectly, like it was Bonchon. Seemed to have a solid wine menu, and the chocolate mousse dessert was also good, though a bit rich for me. Whole thing was too expensive, so have to keep it 4 star at best, cuz I couldnt just come here outside work. Don’t know if I’ll ever be able to go again, but glad to have experienced it. ","2022-06-30 01:01:32.918644+00:00"
"Fresh&Co","False","True","4","Got the Turkey Chili Quinoa salad - don’t let the “salad” name fool you; this was a burrito bowl. Portion size was great for the price. Heavy on the savory side though, might seem bland for fans of spice. Also wish they had more customizable options, but I’d still order here again. ","2022-05-03 19:10:47.960191+00:00"
"North River Lobster Company","False","True","3","So the big schtick at this place is that they ferry you around for an hour on the water while you enjoy your meal and/or drinks. The views were ok, nice city view but heard that there are much better areas to sail around. Lobster rolls were solid and burgers were actually good too, but not special enough to come here for a burger. The biggest issue with the whole setup is that the boat feels like it’s rocking a lot so I constantly had a little bit of seasickness that made eating p difficult. Fun for the novelty but probably wouldn’t come back. ","2022-08-12 21:24:21.188354+00:00"
"The Blue Dog Cookhouse and Bar","False","True","3","Place is super cramped and decent wait. Got the Notorious DOG burger, yeah nothing too special, guess the egg was good. Lots of options but felt way overpriced. Fries were soft and dark. Also why was the music that loud in a cafe looking place? Hard to communicate, and large plants on each “table” made it hard to see (I say table since most patrons are seated on the same 1 long table, regardless of group). Probably better options out there, especially considering location. ","2022-05-08 17:20:20.340275+00:00"
"Levain Bakery","False","True","5","Giant cookies, decent priced. I realize I tend to give all cookie places 4 stars so you can skip this review but all im saying is the chocolate chips are bursting with flavor. Not as many options as other spots but the flavors they do have usually suffice. ","2022-07-21 02:40:59.079217+00:00"
"Sticky's Finger Joint","False","True","4","Not sure why this wasn’t 5 stars. The Thai chili chicken tenders were hella good (think Harrisonburg Sticky Nugz for reference), and the leftover sauce and oil sticks into the fries for a double treat. The fries were also the perfect amount of fried and crispy, and the spicy chicken sandwich was also solid (but not crispy or spicy enough to beat the best of DC/VA). Even prices were reasonable and vibe was chill, so this could easily have been a 5/5, but something just felt like a 4. Will still go back though. ","2022-06-04 03:41:30.717628+00:00"
"Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ","False","True","4","Classic Asian BBQ spot, same style as K-BBQ. Meat was for the most part all really good, even like the cuts of meat chosen were all pretty juicy and solid, without too much fat. I didnt try sushi but that also looked good, and shrimps were decent. They have a pretty large bar too. I will say one tough thing is it’s pretty pricey and they didn’t seem to have any all-you-can eat option. That being said, I went in a group and we ended up ordering so much it basically felt all you can eat; split that many ways the cost wasn’t bad either. Solid experience, would def bring people back. (They also bring you free ice cream for bdays).","2022-07-07 21:56:17.612337+00:00"
"Sacco Pizza","False","True","3","Went off @vamsi’s rec. I will qualify that I probably should’ve started with a simple cheese, but I was pretty hungry. Got a full pie to share, but it was a bit costly, each topping is an additional $3. I got the standard bbq chicken (chicken & onions), but it really just felt like cheesy onion bread. Biiig onion stocks with some shredded chicken here and there - got sick of the strong onion by the end. The cheese and marinara itself was fine, nothing special. Best thing was the crust was nicely firm and filling, but it also means once you finish the pizza part, eating the crust is kind of tough. This place wasn’t as bad as others (Justinos) so ill give it another try, but just fine for now - not a NY necessity","2022-06-09 13:53:14.264391+00:00"
"Pure Ktchn","False","True","3","To be fair, I really wanted the Buffalo Cauliflower burger, but that definitely isn’t healthy. This place goes for the Vegan/Health double combo but idk if that’s technically true for all its dishes. I got the Warm Protein Bowl, which ngl I was very scared of. Basically texture was like lukewarm lentils (even tho there are no lentils in the dish…). A lot of different flavors that are usually good on their own (cinnamon, coconut, etc) but kinda all parse together in this mash. The bananas are overwhelmed and just feel like baby food (tbf so does the whole dish). Silent MVP was the fig jam. I won’t give it a 2 cuz I did finish the whole thing, not gross. Just not noteworthy. ","2022-08-03 16:10:21.400792+00:00"
"Mama's Pizza","False","True","2","It’s basically cheese toasted on sliced bread, pretty mediocre. To be fair, i chose this place cuz it’s a flat $1 per cheese slice and it’s 30 seconds away from home. So you get the convenience you pay for; if you want marginally better quality try literally any other pizza place (except Justino’s) or idk, Walmart frozen pizza?","2022-05-14 00:12:29.725873+00:00"
"Nizza","False","True","4","Classic urban italian restaurant. They were willing to customize the meat options in the orders so that was cool. Got the basil pesto with shrimp and the cacio e pepe with chicken. They were even nice enough to bring Tiramisu with candle for a bday. Only downside was they still included it on the bill. I ordered a Sprite that was super flat, so asked them if they could just switch it for sparkling water, they said yeah and took away the full glass but still charged me for both drinks too. Other tables had Pizza and chicken parms, those also looked tasty. Would go back to try.","2022-08-03 18:19:06.384444+00:00"
"Sherwood To Go","False","True","3","The only reason this is above 2 stars is because the beef was not entirely gross, and it was big enough to be filling. There was no cheese in half of my philly cheesesteak.. think about that for a second. There are technically only 2 key ingredients in this sandwich and they were missing one. The second half technically had a slice of cheddar sticking out the end. ","2022-07-20 16:20:19.295776+00:00"
"dell'anima","False","True","3","Urban italian place that is both its own restaurant and also part of a larger food court. Food was good but small portion sizes and not really anything to write home about. Also cost feels high compared to amount of food. They have a nice bar with an open window and seems like nice drink selection. The rest of the food court has other options, like ice cream, so was a fun place to go with a group, nice vibe, but on its own for food I probably wouldn’t go myself.

"Tacos Grand Central","False","True","4","I got the grilled chicken breast tacos and had them hours later - were still fire. Had delivery so cant speak to the ambiance of the place but Id be down to check in person if everything atleast hits this standard","2022-05-03 02:52:39.738999+00:00"
"Valla Table","False","True","4","Solid thai food, solid ambience. Nothing bad to say really, avg prices, good thai tea, and wings were phenomenal. ","2022-08-28 18:08:07.913300+00:00"
"Bleecker Street Pizza","False","True","2","Bare minimum pizza. First bite was good only cuz it was warm. Largely flavorless cheese. The worst part was the crust, felt like burnt cardboard. The cheese kinda fell off the end so you only get crust in your last few bites. Not really worth it cuz a) lots of other pizza in the area (shoutout John’s) and b) it’s literally right next to a Taco Mahal","2022-09-14 12:51:33.884819+00:00"
"V{IV}","False","True","4","Was tempted to give this a 5, possibly the best Drunken Noodles (Pad See Ew) I’ve had in NY. My biggest issues with Thai noodles are that they are usually 1) too hot/too spicy or 2) too many extra toppings, so you can’t enjoy enough of the noodles. This place solved both, because their DNoodles are simple so you enjoy the core dish, and if you want spicy then you order the Key Mao (basically same dish). The Thai Fried crispy wings are also a secret MVP, definitely try with hot sauce, and classic Thai iced tea is solid (if you leave a review online you get one for free!). Also has a cool ambience; only reason it doesn’t get a 5 is because it’s a bit too club-vibe (dark lighting, blasting music) and people in my group got the Pad Thai w/Beef said it was waay too sweet.

"Route 66","False","True","4","Apologies for the grainy pic - solid burger/american spot in Hell’s Kitchen. Nice aesthetic but paired down by the dark mood lighting… Staff was also pretty helpful, tho our guy seemed really new. The hickory burger was good, classic bbq style with sweet grilled onions. They were also pretty accomodating, in swapping someone’s patty for Turkey and letting another customize their order. Prices werent terrible either. Could definitely go back when im in the mood for a thoughtless burger. ","2022-07-14 02:34:18.274744+00:00"
"Haswell Green's","False","True","3","Very college bar vibe, which makes sense cuz recommended by someone stuck in their 20’s. Dark lighting, bit too loud music, and becomes a dance bar after 10, but not nice enough to actually be nice. Smash burger was actually solid but i was starving and it was p overpriced. Not offensive but I probably wouldn’t go back.","2022-10-09 18:04:24.841558+00:00"
"The Garret","False","True","4","Imagine you’re with a bickering group. Half are hungry and wanna grab a nice heavy meal. The other half are ready to get the night started (or wind down) with drinks.

"Don Antonio","False","True","3","Stuck between 3 and 4, coulda been a 4, but a few things. I was really craving a sitdown calzone and it def delivered on that, very flavorful and the mushroom cheese was delicious. I think I was craving cheap calzone though because this felt fancy but too soft and doughy for me. Also the Arugula Pizza had waaayy too much Arugula for me (see pictured) and it was spicy, so kinda killed the pizza vibe. Service was nice, also location was so cool, it looks small but opens into a wide brick seating which was cool. Altho they were blasting EDM music, weird vibe for sitdown Italian…","2022-07-18 22:55:24.772884+00:00"
"Mom's Kitchen & Bar","False","True","5","Literally my go to brunch place, I’ve taken everyone here. Pancake burrito will fill you up, breakfast sandwich is also great and they’ll replace turkey bacon with fried chicken fillet. The lean muscle option good for people looking for healthier food, and the milkshakes are insane (red velvet includes a whole cake!). ","2022-07-17 21:02:25.207736+00:00"
"Texas Rotisserie & Grill","False","True","5","Got the ice tea this time during my finance workday, while working in finance. Solid and refreshing, along with the great portion sizes. No complaints!","2022-08-04 16:29:31.952584+00:00"
"Wu's Wonton King","False","True","4","Cool location in LES, though they gave us a rezzy at 9 only to inform us kitchen was closing (lights off 9:20) so that was weird and mildly stressful. It also seems I had a different experience than @skanda cuz I was not expecting portion sizes to be that big, felt like we ordered waaaay too much chicken 😂. But tbf the food was solid, and I was even pleasantly surprised by the Pan-Fried noodles that taste like a fancier Maggi noodle (even had the crunch!). The biggest cons were the staff really didnt want to serve us, lol or even take our orders, and there was a giant cockrouch flying around the roof (we were in covered seating outside) but the staff was helpful enough to take care of it. We were probably there least favorite patrons overall. Also fun fact, they do take card but Bill is in chinese. ","2022-07-19 16:04:23.147225+00:00"
"Miss Du’s Tea Shop","False","True","4","Thought about giving this place a 5, cuz it really didnt do anything wrong. It’s a milkshake, juice, and boba tea spot and it served all of those. And they were all really good. Kind a cute vibe, I guess the only improvement it could’ve had is some seating - pretty cramped in the shop itself. But again, as far as service provided, the drinks were excellent and I had no issues. Got the strawberry banana milkshake myself and it was surprisingly well balanced level of sweetness. Also right in the heart of Chinatown so fun walking too. ","2022-07-08 18:01:20.429666+00:00"
"Rowdy Rooster","False","True","3","Agree with the over reviews of this place. Between a 3 and a 4, but for me a 4 is a place I’d definitely go back to, so im going with 3. Solid chicken sandwich but otherwise nothing crazy. It’s basically bun kebab, but fried chicken instead of potato patty. And if you want spicier they just layer on more red chili. I think I got level 2 off their rec, but probably could have done 3 cuz 2 wasn’t really spicy. Which is funny cuz there was still so much red chili powder that it gets all over your hands. Also restaurant is cramped and tables always full, get lucky or have a backup eating space. ","2022-09-24 15:36:15.646700+00:00"
"Deep Indian Kitchen - Columbus Circle","False","True","2","Don’t know why I wasted my time on this place again. Tried the paneer this time, super bland and soggy. Also I got the “homemade” Mango Lassi - not only does it taste like it’s from a carton, it’s also bad. It’s a thick thick yoghurt with a slight tinge of something your basic white elementary teacher wouldn’t even dare to pass of as mango. Very disappointing. ","2022-06-22 16:08:03.074839+00:00"
"Rancho Tequileria","False","True","4","Are you looking to celebrate your sexual identity and have a solid taco? This place has got you covered. Think flamboyant Chevy’s with solid classics like the fajita burrito and more recent hits like the birria tacos. Price is standard for the area, but when you’re craving Mexican and TBell just isn’t going to cut it, look no further. ","2022-08-15 23:32:13.827320+00:00"
"Baazi","False","True","5","Alright Tastefans, here’s the one you’ve all been waiting for. Of course I was invited to the premier Emerald-event of the season, the Baazi Gala, a live all-inclusive dinner hosted by the og founders of taste @srikanth @Ani .
What an experience. 
Off of Ani’s rec, I got the Bharwan Bhaingan (Eggplant), and it was soo good. The sweet creamy curry is perfectly paired with the thick, savory eggplant. Also tried @priya ‘s Malai Kofta and enjoyed how creamy it was, coconut-curry like. 
They also gave @vamsi a mocktail of their popular Indian Summer drink, so thats awesome, and one of the apps was literally flamed.
I was very tempted to agree with @anoop on this one, 4 out of 5. If Ani hadnt given recs I woulda had no idea what to order, also had none of the classics on the menu. 
Where. My. Butter. Paneer. At?
Also had the audacity to call something “Amma’s Biryani” as if anything can reach that standard/my mom’s biryani. Not even just homemade, but your Mom’s quality?? Relax fam. 
But I read their story on the website, and as a “Baazi” is a bet, their goal was also to bet on their bold, non-traditional menu. In that regard they succeeded wholeheartedly, and since I really can’t say anything bad about the place I gotta give it a 5.  Also, shoutout to my boy @skanda just cuz im name dropping everybody now apparently","2022-07-21 02:33:19.423897+00:00"
"Justino's Pizza","False","True","2","Was going to give it 3 stars. The bbq pizza was 2 star but if you imagine it’s an indian sweet chili chicken on naan, it’s a 4 star, so avg is 3 star; and also the meat patties were classic and amazing. Buuuut, was in the bathroom for an hour this morning so turns out this place as trash as it looked. Id only go back for a meat patty (until I find another spot for them).","2022-05-07 15:19:28.591351+00:00"
"Naya","False","True","5","I was skeptical trying this spot cuz falafel is notorious, but Im glad to say I was very pleasantly surprised. Got the chicken shawarma bowl - good portion size for value price, and I still have leftovers. If you get this place do not skimp on the toppings - the Hummus, Baba Ghanoush, and Olives were amazing. Perfect strength of flavor without going overboard, and tasted like true authentic Lebanese (as someone who’s eaten in Beirut many times). Chicken shish is one of my measuring sticks for these places so I got a side protein order, and it was good. My gold standard is shawarma though and I’m very particular with that, so I’m happy to say the shawarma also tasted pretty authentic. Im definitely going to go back and try a proper wrap and see how the OG stacks up. 10/10 recommend for fast casual.","2022-05-16 17:15:24.560796+00:00"
"Jams NYC","False","True","3","Fish tacos were actually pretty good. Chopped carrots looked like they were literally pulled out of the ground so kinda wack. Falafel looked more like a burger. Had the ambiance of a place that should be vegan. ","2022-05-03 02:49:11.942614+00:00"
"Pergola","False","True","2","Prices were offensive. Lamb burger was nothing special, too much feta so lamb was overpowered and got full waaay too fast. The fries actually had too much seasoning too so they get kind of gross, like your hands after eating this food. Mocktail mojoti was solid but not worth the $10. My group got the hookah and apparently it was super burnt; charcoal after taste. Will say the vibe was pretty cool, very modern chiq club vibe. Probably not worth going again.

"Galaxy Diner","False","True","3","Realistically more like a 4 but ive given too many 4’s lately and this was borderline, so we’re going 3. We were seated outside which was fine but the tables were too small so even the server was about to spill some of the sauces (tho they did join some tables). Was kinda hard to pick anything on the menu cuz they have a ton of options but a bit too customized, esp when ur feeling just a solid, classic brunch. I will say I got the protein omelette (only option with egg and chicken) and it was good, but brocolli all clumped to 1 side. Also in order to get a waffle we had to order it on its own as an entree - 1 single waffle should not cost as much as a whole entree. Honestly biggest thing working against this place is it’s 2 blocks away from the GOAT of brunch spots - Mom’s Kitchen, so why would I ever choose anything else.","2022-07-19 16:10:23.435481+00:00"
"The Cheesecake Factory","False","True","1","The shepherd’s pie cannot be called pie - it was a soup.

"Joe's Pizza","False","True","4","Not amazing but as far as cheese slices go it’s solid. No real complaints. This place is really famous as a prime example of Classic NY Slice, I can see it, though the crust was kind of soft. Also they only take cash, kinda wild for a large and popular establishment. Line was long but moved really quickly, and the pizza was hot and ready waiting. Solid option but you don’t have to go out of your way to eat at this place, most Pizza options would suffice.

"Ragtime","False","True","4","Decent spot, somewhere between 3.5 to 4 stars. Food wasn’t amazing but pretty good overall. Got the biscuits, chicken, and gravy, was very savory - def recommend getting with the poached eggs (as shown) for full flavor. The bayou burrito was also good, and pretty filling portions for price, so good value. Was nice that they had availability on a busy brunch day and different choices for seating. Wouldn’t be my first choice in the area but also solid backup.","2022-05-31 20:04:34.239567+00:00"
"Wo Hop Restaurant","False","True","4","Decent spot, food was good and you get a lot per serving. Also amazing considering this is probably one of the cheapest spots I’ve had in NY so far, so great value for your spend. Orange chicken comes with actual orange slices, which is a bit much for me but still good; large chunks. Also don’t overthink this - I got the basic chicken lo mein and recommend you do the same.

"DIG","False","True","2","Trying too hard to be healthy. Bland carrots, mac n cheese was fine, chicken was average. “Hot honey chicken” is just a little bit of sweet dressing. Not worth it","2022-05-17 20:34:12.438373+00:00"
"Lenwich","False","True","5","Solid sandwich place, been a few times and have not had a bad experience. Also available all over the city. Got the Big Daddy last time for a bus ride and ate it hours later and it was still fire - juicy steak paired with spicy peppers and sweet sauce. Prices are a bit high compared to like a local deli, but not the worst. Very acceptable anytime you want a NYC sub. ","2022-08-23 15:46:05.462198+00:00"
"Taqueria Local","False","True","5","Used to be my go-to Taco Spot at DC, especially while at work. The regular steak or chicken are good but the beast on the menu is the Champinon (portobello mushroom) tacos. The texture feels like beef but super flavorful and the special sauce it comes with is a perfect almost-sweet savory compliment. Not since Big Mac sauce has a secret sauce ever stood out this way. 10/10 recommend","2022-05-13 22:36:56.992705+00:00"
"Baked by Melissa","False","True","5","I can see why people would dislike this place because it is literally bite-sized cupcakes and they’re like a dollar each, which is kind of horrendous considering how small they are. If you are ok with this then they are actually phenomenal - perfectly balanced flavor, so many different options, and it never gets really heavy like most cupcakes. Will def go again when I want a quick sweet. ","2022-08-09 19:30:22.300585+00:00"
"Uncle Julio's","False","True","4","Got the chicken fajitas order and I was very satisfied. Tortillas are unlimited so very easy to pile on one after the other. Not the best mexican I’ve ever had but gets points for vibes, especially since it’s in the heart of Ashburn’s bustling 1Loudoun district.","2022-04-28 15:32:36.405076+00:00"
"Poké Inn","False","True","4","This was surprisingly good, considering there was no line and the restaurant smelled funky. But all the ingredients definitely felt fresh, got salmon and bbq eel which somehow actually worked together. The seaweed was the right amount of seasoned and they had decent topping options, like crab salad and mango. Pretty reasonable price too, so I’ll definitely be eating here more often.","2022-05-15 22:25:01.762711+00:00"
"Liberty Bagels","False","True","3","The Jack Turkey on Everything bagel was pretty boring… Peppers and Onions were huge but tasteless, along with basically all the rest of the sandwich. I can’t in good faith recommend this place but I think I also chose a bad option - breakfast bagels looked good and the overall vibe was cool; very urban deli. Id go back to try breakfast but that’s it. ","2022-05-09 17:42:18.330557+00:00"

"Bar Pisellino","False","True","3","You can largely ignore this review cuz I don’t drink, lol, and apparently the drinks here are really good. But the rest of the menu seemed to be really just be pastries so as a dinner option it’s a no from me dog. Also there’s always a long wait so I assumed it was like a big lively french bar but it’s basically a cafe inside. There aren’t really any tables - just benches along the walls with stools.

"Thai Villa","False","True","4","Have you ever wondered what EY interns talk about right before going back to school? Man have I got the place for you. Food was good, but not spectacular like how I’m hearing. Everyone talks up the ambience inside but it was 40min wait inside vs immediate table outside so… Drunken Noodles were solid, the Khao Sae chicken literally fell off the bone (broth itself was fine). Will say prices felt high even for Thai, but I guess it is supposed to be on the fancier side. Good option if you’re in the area but wouldn’t go out of my way for it.

"Van Leeuwen Ice Cream","False","True","5","Im not a big ice cream guy but also I think I’m easily satisfied. But the honeycomb and peanut butter honeycomb flavors here were amazing, light but just enough sweet. Almost felt refreshing. Could be 4 stars cuz the smallest cup is still $6 but whatever, no issues. Would recommend.  ","2022-10-09 18:01:54.874560+00:00"
"Shaking Crab","False","True","4","Solid seafood spot; got the lobster roll with cajun fries and they gave us some roasted cajun corn-on-the-cob for free. The roasted corn was actually delicious, crispiness added to the corn so it has more texture than usual and the cajun seasoning adds zest to the usually tame corn. The cajun fries were equally yummy. I will say the lobster roll was fine, bit more tart than savory compared to what Im used to, which is also tough considering it’s on the more expensive side of orders (it is still lobster). On the flip side, they let us also order from the kids menu and I feel like that’s pretty rare. Vibe as a whole also ok, nice staff but kind of tight space squished between 2 bars. ","2022-07-14 02:30:25.360345+00:00"
"Toasties","False","True","3","Got mom’s meatloaf with mashed potatoes and corn. Was expecting atleast boston market quality but it was pretty bland. Meatloaf is usually fun, good texture or strong meat taste or both - this was neither. Mashed potatoes were good but hard to screw those up, and corn was fine, nothing special. Both corn and meatloaf left a lot of liquid, which was kind of gross. 

To be fair I think this is known as a sandwich place, so will have to try a sando next time and re-evaluate.","2022-05-11 18:44:14.761372+00:00"
"Two Boots Pizza - West Village","False","True","4","Definitely a place to come visit - real cool 60’s vibe in this place. And lots of crazy pizza options, reminds me of Mello Mushroom. Only reason it doesn’t get a 5 is cuz they use a decent amount of some spice; maybe oregano? Which means you’re getting a slightly different kind of pizza. Not bad, but I wouldn’t be able to make it a go-to pizza stop, id have to be in the mood for this specifically. But definitely worth a stop if you’re in West Village","2022-09-14 12:55:25.700797+00:00"
"Kikoo","False","True","5","All you can eat sushi. Food was great, large selection, and even sides/apps/some desserts included in all-you-can-eat bill, which is rare. $40 per person which is good considering most nice spots are like $10-20 per roll. Quick and friendly service too, no complaints would come again. ","2022-12-20 22:05:59.142827+00:00"
"Deep Indian Kitchen - Columbus Circle","False","True","3","You know when you accidentally stumble upon a spot and somehow find something amazing, but then it never seems as good the next time? (Except courthouse kabob) Well I got the kathi rolls from Deep with @srikanth last time we were all in NY and thought they were solid. Unfortunately they did not seem to live up. 

I think part of it may have gotten messed up in delivery, because it seemed all the masala had dripped to the bottom of the roll. Halfway through the paratha was all soggy and falling apart, and the level 2 spice was mild until the last bite, where it proceeded to slap with an afterburn. Probably should’ve gotten the paneer instead of chicken tikka wraps. Also Samosas were solid albeit soggy as well. I’ll give it another try for the platter next time but that’ll be it after that - too many good indian places in NYC to waste on mediocre. ","2022-06-01 19:59:53.979199+00:00"
"Sense of Thai St","False","True","4","The food is delicious and service was also excellent. It loses points though because every dish has so much in it that everyone ends up customizing their orders somehow (no onions, less spice etc.) Also the food never gets cold, which is great until you realize your mouth can’t stop burning. ","2022-03-22 13:00:45.437222+00:00"
"Taco Mahal","False","True","5","This place took a different path. Instead of being mediocre at a few different things, they decided to master the Chicken Tikka Masala and then just put that in everything. The Wings were fire - basically bigger chicken lollipops. Bit pricey but worth it. The samosas were solid and paired perfectly. Will say the biryani was ok, good meat portions but not spicy enough, but tbf they’re known for meat not rice. Definitely a cool experience and I have to go back to get the famous Tikka Burrito - table behind us got it and it looked so good. ","2022-08-24 12:54:13.525962+00:00"
"Jack's Wife Freda","False","True","4","This is borderline 4 to 5. Great ambiance on the edge of SoHo and Little Italy, very cute brunch spot. The burger was small but also so tasteful, and the fries were perfect level of crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside. We also got our table without wait, and they gave us free refill coffee even though it technically ended at 4.  All in all, great experience, and I have to go back to try the rose waffle. ","2022-07-18 23:51:09.796635+00:00"
"Café Bilboquet","False","True","5","It’s ok, we can be basic with this one. Have they recreated a bougie, basic french cafe on Madison Avenue? Yes. Did I still love it? Yes. Velvet chairs, “gold” chandeliers, faux french paintings, the works. Very cute spot, very nice staff. The berry margarine (i think?) looked amazing, I would’ve got it for the perfect orchard color alone.  Mini pain au chocolats are hard to mess up and these did not disappoint. Smoked salmon was also tasty, but MVP was probably the quiche, eggs and veggies were a perfect compliment and it had the right crisp on the crust. Also the fresh iced coffee was very smooth and refreshing on a warm day. Again, probably a cheesy spot but they lean into it, so just go and enjoy cafe culture at its finest (funnest?)","2022-06-26 22:53:22.610501+00:00"
"Schmackary's","False","True","5","Imagine the scene. It’s around 10pm on a weekday night, too late to really do anything. You had a filling dinner earlier and just feel like something sweet would pair the night down well. You walk the streets tho and everything seems to be closed… no options.. you’re gonna have to go home sugarless. Until you turn a corner and see “Schmackary’s”. From the getgo, the wide window and childish signs seem very inviting. You walk in and the cashier says “hey, everything’s buy 1 get 1 free, so enjoy 2 sweets for the price of 1!”. Your heart skips a beat, because you were already struggling to pick 1 flavor of cookie to try, so now you get both. The peanut butter chocolate chip is a dream and the orea cookies n cream is the bed you dream it on.  And then, as you’re leaving, the place says “hey.. we’re closing.. so if you want anything else it’s on the house”. You can’t believe what you’re hearing, you must be in heaven. You grab yourself a well-earned blondie and sign up for their rewards program. You will definitely come back (and btw since it’s your bday month, they give you a bday giftcard!)","2022-07-08 18:15:21.050857+00:00"
"Local 92","False","True","4","First off, great ambiance, right in the heart of a food street in Ukrainian Village. Definitely recommend as a date spot but can also take friends. Very lively but never too loud. Cool aesthetic with wooden tables and middle eastern decor/archways, stone walls, and candles. Falafel Taste appetizer was kinda tough but the green sauce it came with pairs it down well. Shakshouka was also good, and you can add items if you want more filling. Chicken Tahine was amazing, plums were perfectly sweet without overpowering the dish. It also came with couscous, which was a nice surprise. Got the Tiramisu at the end too which was very nicely fluffy with a light crispy outside. All in all, no complaints, definitely would go back.  ","2022-06-26 22:45:52.590705+00:00"
"Dc Pizza & Kabob","False","True","5","Jumbo pizza is very oily but otherwise flavorful and great ratios. Chicken gyro is delicious, wrap or bowl. Fries fried in batter so extra crispy (lots of oil). Best part is consistency!","2022-03-24 13:43:37.532637+00:00"
"Lapis","False","True","4","Really cute spot near chill Kalorama Park (AdMo) DC. Got the potato and beef “flatbreads” (it’s paratha). Tasted fine, bit thick for my preference. The real secret winner was the pancakes. I can not stress enough how worth-it it is to try these. They are cooked with rosewater in the batter so they have a little sweet tinge at the end of each bite - I would 100% go back alone just for these. Also the whole restaurant has a nice brunch vibe so all in all a good time. ","2022-07-11 17:12:36.732524+00:00"
"7th Street Burger","False","True","5","Thought about giving this a 4 but honestly, for what it was trying to be, it really just hit everything. Very simple menu, just the burger, but because of that they’ve kind of mastered their main item. It tastes like a more fresh, more flavorful big mac. Get the double for full bang; it’s not bad prices either. It’s technically a smash burger so I don’t have a lot of experience - I think they are supposed to be crispier but i didn’t really mind. Also couldve been a 4 because i dont think you can customize, but again, they make 1 thing masterfully well and you’re going for that 1 thing. Would def go again (also they have impossible option)","2022-06-26 22:41:34.685770+00:00"
"Pita Yeero","False","True","3","Got the standard bowl. It was really weird because each of the things were pretty weak on its own, so it feels like the restaurant tries to make up for it by just stuffing it up with soooo much food. Literally had shawarma chicken, hummus, baba ghanoush, salad, dolma (grape leaves) fries, vermicelli rice, and pita all in the one bowl order! Very stuffing, but again, classic case of quantity over quality; but where a buffet or multi-stack burger can get away with this, this place the mediocrity kind of shines thru.

"Mama's Pizza","False","True","4","Since it’s the pizza place closest to me I keep going back. I got the full cheese pie first and that was surprisingly delicious - waaaay better than the single slice, very classic NY flavor. The real game changer was that they are no pork, so I’ve gotten the pepperoni and man that was it. Nothing quite slaps like a fresh halal pepperoni on a late night on the couch. Also pretty good value, never feels like overspending. Probably my go to cheap/late night Pizza. Service is usually pretty funny too, and usually not much wait. ","2022-06-09 13:57:04.697636+00:00"
"Oh K-Dog","False","True","5","Really unique experience! I think this place is famous for something else, but get the egg on toast! I was a little skeptical from the look but it’s a very interesting taste! Huuuuge omelette in the middle of soft garlic bread, with lots of sweet and spicy paste inside. The tastes compliment each other very well and it’s topped with cool avocado. And only like $10 total, but you’ll be soooo full. Definitely worth it","2022-07-07 22:45:03.172180+00:00"
"Magnolia Bakery","False","True","4","This place is pretty famous, specifically for it’s banana pudding, so there’s usually a line but it moves fast. I got a strawberry cupcake from here too- the MVP was the frosting. Light and perfectly fluffy, flavorful but not overwhelmingly sweet. The cupcake itself was fine, I prefer my cake to be a bit stronger especially when no filling. Also tried the famous banana pudding - I’ll admit it was delicious but also just felt like something I could make at home, so really had no business paying $8 for.

"Village Square Pizza","False","True","4","Solid sicilian. They only have the one style it seems but lots of different topping options.

"Lilly's Craft & Kitchen","False","True","2","They say never to judge a book by its cover and they were absolutely right. This place had so much promise, gastropub chic, but alas there were no dubz to be taken. Buffalo tots were a solid 3 (out of five), Lily Burger was undercooked, turkey burger was overcooked, and fries were soggy. RIP to the $68 I spent here. ","2022-08-15 23:42:01.958630+00:00"
"Rusty Pelican","False","True","5","This place was a vibe! Nice, neo-fancy aesthetic right by Miami waterfront with a view of Downtown/Brickell skyline. Got the lobster roll, very fresh and filling, and reasonably priced. Don’t get the large chicken n veggies options, too much food, but otherwise everything seemed like a hit. For those who drink it seemed to have popular drink options too. All an all a classic Miami stop, worth checking out. ","2022-05-30 13:39:11.349264+00:00"
"Red Poke","False","True","3","Got a make-your-own poke bowl. Kind of dry overall, everything felt thrown together (probably cuz of rush hour?). Decent portion size but little bit on the pricier side. None of the flavors really jumped out the way fresh poke usually does (tho it was delivery so…). Also never seen a Poke place that didnt have crab or spicy tuna options before.","2022-05-05 16:00:46.437121+00:00"
"Muscle Maker Grill","False","True","4","Alright ill admit, i definitely wanted to like this place, so my review might be biased. But that’s cuz i was excited from the get-go. Even tho it’s mostly wraps, burgers, and bowls, they still manage to have pretty diverse menu options (mexican, teriyaki, etc) all with different health benefits/specialties (high proteins, low carb, keto, etc.). Got the ground Turkey wrap with side of Quinoa - from the first bite of the wrap i felt the leanness of the Turkey, but it also had a chili kind of seasoning so it popped a little. Felt a little much by the end but not overwhelming. I will say quinoa’s kinda boring, not bad but just plain. Also they have meal prep trays you can order for delivery, and this whole thing was only around 10bucks! All in all, very satisfied, definitely worth when you want something good after a workout/on a healthy week. ","2022-06-29 16:16:05.742681+00:00"
"Amorino Gelato","False","True","4","Gelato was delicious, got the coffee and the hazelnut, both slapped. Biggest issues with this place are that the line is constantly long, it’s around time square so a lot suss people coming in, and it feels too cramped to sit inside. Great gelato but too much of a hassle to make it the go-to gelato spot, atleast this location (there’s another by NYU)","2022-08-12 21:29:21.410437+00:00"

"Iron Age Korean Steak House","False","True","4","Yeah i mean it’s a good K-bbq place. Ambiance is also cool, the music’s a bit loud but cool watching K-pop music videos while you wait. Usually a pretty long wait tho. Also I personally thought the meat at Meat Project across the street was better but this is $5 cheaper per person and at the end of the day if it’s good enough all you can eat bbq meat it’s good. Skip the chicken unfortunately, was the weakest of the meats. Squid was surprisingly good but Hawaiian bulgogi beef was prolly the MVP.","2022-09-11 17:18:21.359383+00:00"
"Tina's Cuban Cuisine","False","True","3","I say ok but it’s really more of a 3.5 to 4 stars. It’s not necessarily something I’d get again but idk if im the biggest fan of Cuban food - probably more of a classic Mexican/TexMex guy. Grilled chicken was decent portion, rice was good but too much to finish. Made the mistake of getting Maduros (fried plantain) instead of Yuca, did not need sweetness in this order. The potato salad was a surprise MVP, perfectly balanced mayo ratio, flavor, and seasoning. Dont get the tostada - it’s a bun..","2022-05-12 21:28:12.202546+00:00"
"Kohoku-Ku Ramen","False","True","5","I’m probably not the best ramen taster so my review is biased anyways. But food was really good, got the veggie ramen with fried tempura, everything was flavorful and savory. They had great options too, which is important to me, it was hard to pick a flavor. Also reasonably priced and the vibe felt very authentic; they go for an “old ramen shop” setup with wood and stools and interesting wall decor. Prob more tourist trap considering the location but idm. They also let me customize my order (remove leeks, add eggs) which was nice, some places don’t. Would def go again.","2022-05-22 15:32:34.522943+00:00"
"Tupelo Honey","False","True","4","Got the classic chicken and waffles. Very filling and enough to share. I really enjoyed the white sauce glaze, surprisingly complimented the syrup. Nice and crispy chicken too. Vibe at brunch was also nice, even sitting at the bar was lively and allowed us to bypass the long wait. Place is a bit pricey tho, and don’t get the 1/2 sandwich option - not filling enough. ","2022-05-30 13:35:03.172626+00:00"
"Two Hands","False","True","3","Everyone raves about Korean CornDogs, apparently this time they weren’t as good as usual. Felt mostly like a giant fried cheese ball. Will have to try again, maybe without a group. Be warned, 4 guys split 1. It is really calorie intensive and just really heavy overall. I think I have to try again but dont think id be able to finish one alone. Cheese was fine, breading was kind of interesting (think tater tots) and the red korean seasoning was pretty tame.

"Max Brenner","False","True","4","Solid dessert place in Union Sq, altho there are other locations. The “iconic” pair for 2 has all desserts in a bowl; ice cream, brownies, strawberries, sprinkles, whipped cream, and chocolate. Can be shared by 2 or even 4, which is great cuz otherwise prices are a bit high. Venue’s always pretty lively - personally I think I’d still prefer an affordable local bakery but this stop is great for nights out with a group. ","2022-09-04 15:05:57.128582+00:00"
"Raku","False","True","4","Solid experience. Got the Oyako Don (egg& chicken ricebowl) with Eel sauce. Portion size was huge and very filling, flavors worked well with eachother. The miso soup wasn’t it tho, tasted watery. Ill have to go in person one of these days to try the Ramen and Sushi, as well as see the vibe.

"Omar's Mediterranean Cuisine","False","True","3","I can’t say it was bad, just fine. Got the chicken shawarma platter - chicken was a bit overcooked, and also got rice in my baba ganoush. They give you free pita and sauces with your order, which sounds great except it doesn’t say upfront so I wasted a side on sauce. Also you get a free baklava but it was giant and pretty stiff/bland. 

Not a terrible option, and Ive heard it’s better in person but I think I’ll stick to Naya for Mediterranean. ","2022-05-31 20:10:57.706264+00:00"
"Wondee Siam","False","True","3","This was between a 3 and a 4 for me, but @Ani gave it a 5 so my expectations were too high; therefore it gets a 3. Got the Key Mao cuz the flat noodles reminded me of Drunken Noodles (which this place doesn’t serve btw..). The noodles themselves were actually fantastic, 5/5, but it just came with so much extra stuff that you barely get room to enjoy the noodles. Something that looked like broccoli mixed with Brussel sprouts. Pad Thai looked nice but i was nervous cuz the waitress emphasized how sweet they are, and super sweet plus lime zest turns kinda bitter for me. P small shop so nothing much to say about vibe. I’d probably go back to try another dish but prolly wouldn’t be my first choice for now. ","2022-07-08 18:08:17.213315+00:00"

This place is actually a Pakistani buffet, but not the best at that either. Lamb curry was nothing special, okra’s fine, they didnt take out the naan until 2nd round for some reason, and they had the audacity to serve plain rice instead of Biryani. Only reason it gets above terrible is the milk chai (desi tea) was good and the Pakistani uncles debating politics were funny. ","2022-04-29 22:46:12.581161+00:00"
