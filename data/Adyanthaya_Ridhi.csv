"Thierry","False","True","5","Probably the most aesthetic bakery I‚Äôve seen in Vancouver! They have a huge variety of Macaron flavors - we tried the Banana and Lychee flavored macarons and they both were so flavorful üòç We tried the Passionfruit cake which is probably my favorite Passion fruit dessert among the ones I‚Äôve tried! Their tiramisu was also really good. Will definitely visit again to try other desserts! ","2022-10-03 19:20:53.622522+00:00"
"per se Social Corner","False","True","5","We stopped by this place for drinks and snacks, and weren‚Äôt disappointed one bit! For drinks we tried the Pretty in Pink (an Aperol based drink which was my favorite, because it reminded me of Rose Milk ü•π) and Hugo (which had elderflower liqueur) - both of which were amazing. The truffle fries were also really good. Highly recommend this place! Will definitely visit again to try their lunch/dinner menu :)","2022-10-05 04:49:16.712589+00:00"
"Ask for Luigi","False","True","5","Hands down the best Italian restaurant in Vancouver! Have been here a couple of times already. Their Radiatore pasta has been a constant favorite. Always look up what their monthly special pastas are - I‚Äôve tried their Black truffle pasta and their pesto pasta - and they both did not disappoint at all! For desserts, the Olive Oil cake is one I highly recommend. Their Vanilla Pannacotta comes with biscotti and a wine sauce and was really good as well ‚ò∫Ô∏è","2022-09-29 15:38:57.203393+00:00"
"Gupshup","False","True","4","The ambiance at Gupshup was full Bollywood vibes! For food, we tried the paneer cheese rolls which tasted really good but I felt like they were a bit on the dry side. One of our favorite items was the tiger prawns (mainly for the Gongura chutney it comes with, which was A+ ü§åüèª). The Butter Garlic Crab was really good as well (the Garlic flavor can get really strong without pav, fair warning). The biryani was really good as well! I also thought the drinks were very interesting but delicious - I tried the Masala Chai Martini which was quite strong but the chai flavor was a nice change.","2022-09-29 06:15:30.152408+00:00"
"Le District","False","True","5","The collection of pastries I‚Äôve seen at this bakery is unlike anything I‚Äôve seen in a while - they had around 10 types of Eclairs and many different flavors of Macarons! We tried the Hot Chocolate eclair which was basically a chocolate cream-stuffed eclair with marshmallows, and it was amazing! Among macarons, we tried the Earl Grey and the Rose flavors - the Rose was incredibly strong in flavor but the Earl Grey was subtle yet flavorful ‚ò∫Ô∏è","2022-09-29 06:23:30.057384+00:00"
"Italian Kitchen","False","True","5","I had heard of Italian Kitchen as a must-visit Italian place in Downtown Vancouver. The patio is super pretty, filled with plants and pretty flowers. The menu has a select few vegetarian options, but they have a lot of customizable dishes that can be made according to preference. I had the Spinach Ricotta Cannelloni (one of the few standard vegetarian options,
), and the dish was so light yet so filling. Their dessert selections are also very interesting - there‚Äôs the Tiramisu, they had a pistachio panna cotta and a Raspberry Coconut Cake (which was a monthly special) - all of them were on point and the flavors were just right! Definitely visiting again :)","2022-08-02 02:31:05.725069+00:00"
"Holt Renfrew","False","True","4","Holt‚Äôs cafe is located inside Holt Renfrew, which is a Canadian luxury department store! We initially had reserved an Afternoon Tea (which fell apart coz they didn‚Äôt get enough notice - was quite a bummer as we weren‚Äôt told that till we got there üòì)
We still went ahead and had some drinks there, which were really impressive! We tried the La Vie on Rose (which contained Raspberry Gin and Peach Tea Syrup) - I loved the taste of rose and peach, as well as the Monte Cristo (which contained Kahlua, Coffee and Whipping Cream) - this was honestly quite strong but the whipping cream kinda canceled it out - a perfect drink if you need a jolt! Will definitely visit again to try more items ‚ò∫Ô∏è","2022-11-08 05:01:46.552453+00:00"
"Robba Da Matti","False","True","5","Their Pesto Pasta with Burrata was one of the best I‚Äôve ever had!","2022-07-05 23:07:01.307982+00:00"
"Nero waffles","False","True","5","I live super close to Nero and every time I pass by I always get the amazing smell of waffles so have been wanting to try this place always! They have a rotation of flavors for Mini Liege Waffles (with flavors such as Vanilla, Dulce de leche, Churro, Earl Grey), along with savory and sweet waffles. Under savory waffles, I loved the Rocket (which has Havarti cheese, spicy aioli, arugula, poached tomatoes and poached egg). Among sweet waffles, we got the Tiramisu and Banella br√ªl√©e waffles - both of which were light, crispy and not too sweet - a perfect combo. Will gladly come back here to try the other options.","2022-10-21 04:53:30.384637+00:00"
"Anh and Chi","False","True","5","Been craving good Vietnamese food so had to go to one of the best restaurants in Vancouver!  The restaurant is very pretty (wish I got some pics)! For starters, we tried the Fresh Tofu Roll (which was incredibly light) and the Crispy Spring Roll with Mushrooms & Veggies (which was also very flavorful). We also tried the Wok Fried Rice w/ Tofu, the Turmeric Crepe, and the Yellow Lemongrass Curry, all of which were amazing. Our favorites were the Fried Rice and the Yellow Lemongrass Curry!","2022-09-29 06:30:09.940593+00:00"
"Ladur√©e","False","True","5","Ever since I watched Gossip Girl, I‚Äôve always wanted to visit a Ladur√©e store! ü•≤ And honestly, gotta say it was worth it - the Macarons I‚Äôve had were flavorful unlike anything I‚Äôve had before, and the texture omg ü§åüèª
We tried the Rose, Passion Fruit and Marie Antoinette (which is flavored with black tea and rose) macarons - all of which were amazing!
They also have the cutest avo toasts on brioche bread, which also was light and really good.
Their hot chocolate with Chantilly Cream is a little on the expensive side, but honestly I‚Äôm in love - and I think it was 100% worth it! It was so rich and creamy üòç","2022-10-27 23:44:03.662364+00:00"
"Palate Kitchen","False","True","4","Last brunch at Vancouver had to be at Palate kitchen! The chai is very flavorful and comforting for the cold weather. Their avocado toast was light but really good, I feel like I could‚Äôve eaten another order and been okay too üòÖ But my fav thing about the place is that they have this cute Mimosa flight, where you can pick what 3 flavor juices you‚Äôd like with your champagne (options are Orange, Pineapple, Grapefruit and Pomegranate) üòç The Pomegranate juice was honestly my favorite!
One less star solely because we ordered a Mascarpone hot cake (which we were really looking forward to) but it never showed up ü•∫
Would def visit again to try our other items on their menu!","2022-11-22 05:42:52.304623+00:00"
"JINYA Ramen Bar","False","True","5","Starting my last full week in Vancouver with some Ramen! I had the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen which was in fact very creamy and I absolutely loved the fact that it had lots of chili oil üòç There was also this really pretty drink with Gin, Blue Cura√ßao and Lemon Juice, which was really good (tip: make sure to mix the drink even if it looks too pretty üòâ) But the star of the night had to be the Jalapeno Butter Corn (which reminded me a lot of the Masala Corn we get back home)! Will definitely visit again üòå","2022-11-18 05:20:57.874204+00:00"
"Marutama Ra-men","False","True","5","This was the first Ramen place I‚Äôve visited in Vancouver and I‚Äôm not disappointed at all! Their Veggie Curry ramen had a mushroom and coconut milk broth, which reminded me of Maggi üòç The noodles were also very well cooked and it felt very light! Would gladly come back for more ramen!","2022-11-02 04:50:16.243803+00:00"
