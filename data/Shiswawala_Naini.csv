"Mala Sichuan Bistro","False","True","5","Wow, I am not exaggerating when I say this is one of the most delicious places I have been to. We got the Mapo Tofu and the Vegetarian Chow Mein. The spice level that they automatically give is perfect. It burns, but it's a good tingling burn. I'm used to my tofu being baked or fried, but the soft tofu was perfectly flavored. My favorite was the chow mein with vegetables! I love noodles and these were thick, tasty and just perfect. They have a ""lottery"" of some sorts at the end for every customer where you can win a discount on your next visit or dessert. We were not told what the dessert was called was but it was delicious, crispy and made with banana and a hint of coffee. I will be back here again and again and I recommend it to everyone. It was crowded in the middle of the weekday but they have plenty of seating!","2022-06-10 12:56:54.318752+00:00"
"Thai Chef - Rockville","False","True","4","Come here for the vibes and drinks, not specifically the food. My friends and I decided to venture here because we had seen it all over TikTok. The atmosphere was aesthetic for sure, but the food left something to be desired. We got the drunken noodles and curry fried rice. We needed to ask for curry on the side for both of these dishes because it truly lacked flavor. For drinks, I got the purple rain which was very yummy and all my friends seemed to enjoy their drinks. Overall, it's a nice place to try out but there is definitely better Thai food in the area.","2022-06-10 12:55:08.737315+00:00"
"IL RIONE Pizzeria","False","True","5","Best pizza in Cleveland, hands down. I will be coming back here again and again. We did a Green pizza and made our own Margherita with the Calabrian chiles. Delicious! I am a huge pizza fan and I have not found such an amazing place in Cleveland so far. We came really early on a Tuesday evening and yet, it was pretty crowded. There are tables located in the back of the restaurant so I do not think there would be a long wait. I usually never eat the crust but it was perfect. Both pizzas were unique and the toppings were cooked perfectly. I absolutely loved the quality of the cheese and I will be back here very soon! Perfect date night spot!","2022-06-10 12:55:53.677143+00:00"
