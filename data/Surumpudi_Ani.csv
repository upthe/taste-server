"Dominique Ansel Bakery","False","True","5","This place is hyped so I had high expectations coming in especially after I had the shitty cold choc croissant at the Dom Ansel workshop. 

Standout dish by far was the Cronut, exquisitely packaged, presented, and guava flavored. I was worried when they said it wouldn‚Äôt be served warm, but it was amazing and I would come back just for this. 

Choc chip shot was soo good. Milk was sweet because of the cookie and the cookie shot glass itself was warm, chewy, and flavorful. 

Grilled cheese was good but too cheesy. I wish it came with tomato soup.
