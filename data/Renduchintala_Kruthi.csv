"Last Rites","False","True","5","Really cool tropical cocktails, including a handful that light on fire. The decor is so fun & immersive. Recommend the Bahama Trauma (there‚Äôs a limit of 2 per person but wasn‚Äôt that strong üßê) ","2022-05-16 03:25:20.826197+00:00"
"Che Fico","False","True","4","Came here with @sakthi - loved the fried risotto & pineapple pizza with the chili sauce on the side! ","2022-08-15 04:31:21.666325+00:00"
"Dancing Yak Nepali Cuisine & Bar","False","True","4","Loved the paneer tikka - it was pretty unique from other paneer dishes I‚Äôve had!! Vegetarian momos are okay but I go back for the paneer & cocktails - be careful because their definition of spicy is actually super spicy ","2022-05-07 01:44:47.392891+00:00"
"The Patio","False","True","4","Cute spot with fire pits outside - the aviation cocktail was probably my favorite gin cocktail in the city so far! recommend the happy hour appetizers (especially the mac & cheese) & spring pasta, but not the cheeseboard (slightly underwhelming)","2022-05-07 01:36:40.519408+00:00"
"Milan Sweet Center","False","True","4","Got the dahi puri, paneer sizzler, kebab sizzler, and Manchurian sizzler. Almost gave this a 3 but I remember this spot being soo good a couple of years ago in person so I felt guilty ","2022-07-16 07:50:38.921553+00:00"
"Kensh≈ç","False","True","3","vegan sushi in SoCal! Jalape√±o popper & squash blossoms were not bad, but wasn‚Äôt fan of the other two rolls we got. prefer Shizen, wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way to go back ","2022-08-28 23:48:19.546025+00:00"
"Kantine","False","True","3","Really wanted to give this place a 4 and I think it has potential if I order something different so I would go again! I enjoyed the lavender latte, but my brunch dish could have used more spice / flavor and less salt. Divya got the ‚Äúboard‚Äù which you can customize with 5-7 items (ie veggies, dips, cheese, bread, etc) which looked really good! ","2022-08-06 01:30:29.999660+00:00"
"Dumpling Home","False","True","4","Loved the noodles, and the mushrooms / green beans were pretty good. Veg dumplings & bao are a bit flavorless (din tai fung is 10x better!) but I‚Äôd still come again for the overall experience ","2022-07-24 18:15:16.918189+00:00"

"Nopalito","False","True","4","Would come here again for the vibes & fun environment - great place for happy hour and ordering a bunch of small plates to share.

"Greens Restaurant","False","True","4","cute vegetarian spot near off the grid! liked the first courses, main courses were just okay - my friends who aren‚Äôt vegetarian really enjoyed it ","2022-07-09 04:55:14.545431+00:00"
"Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams","False","True","4","@anoop reminded me of this place!! I‚Äôve tried it a few times - brambleberry is my favorite but so far have liked Salt & Straw better üëÄ ","2022-06-22 02:15:17.072294+00:00"

"Nopa","False","True","4","Wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect after seeing @sakthi‚Äôs review but I actually liked this spot!

"Key Klub","False","True","4","New natural wine spot in Nob Hill run by the same owners at bodega! casual atmosphere, fun menu descriptions, and tons of options that apparently can‚Äôt be found in other sf bars. The grilled cheese was amazing, didn‚Äôt love the fries ","2022-05-19 17:16:47.489874+00:00"
"Velvet Taco","False","True","5","@sakthi reminded me of this place - eating a 5 for the paneer taco!! ","2022-08-15 04:24:48.774722+00:00"
"ROOH","False","True","3","Loved the ambience & cocktails/apps are definitely worth trying once, but thought the entrees were underwhelming for the price. Would recommend Ettan in Palo Alto over Rooh! ","2022-05-07 01:41:51.632015+00:00"
"Death by Taco","False","True","3","Casual spot, we grabbed some food and margs here quickly once because it was near caltrain and another time after a Giants game. Just okay, wouldn‚Äôt seek it out - would only come again because of the convenience!","2022-07-23 17:35:00.005061+00:00"

"KAIY≈å","False","True","4","I loved the pisco drinks! Came for drinks / bites instead of dinner (which I would recommend for vegetarians)! Ambiance is nice because of the rooftop, but overall I think LA / other big cities have much nicer rooftops ","2022-07-23 17:29:13.244030+00:00"
