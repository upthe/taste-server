Went here because it’s hyped as one of London’s premier ramen chains on various forums/lists/etc - unfortunately have to report back that it was overhyped. Broth felt pretty watered down, noodle texture didn’t really meet the expectation of “hard” (the equivalent of medium), the shoyu egg didn’t add much to the ramen (it was kind of cold and effectively hard-boiled), and the only spice-inducing element of the entire dish was a single pepper placed on top of the pork (despite me getting the spiciest dish on the menu). Also the place smelled kinda strange ngl lol
