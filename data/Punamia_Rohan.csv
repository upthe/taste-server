"La Taqueria","False","True","5","Quintessential Bay Area burrito. You don’t feel stuffed after you eat it. No rice in burrito. ","2022-02-19 21:25:13.022598+00:00"
"Curry Leaf","False","True","3","Tried it based on a rec from Taste. The curry was decent but nothing to write home about. The naan was disappointing though, it was the thickest - bread like - naan I’ve had! Better than naan crackers (which are the worst) but still far from good naan. Overall I’d give this 3.5 stars. Going to stick with Aditi and Mission Curry House for DoorDash indian! ","2022-04-15 22:28:18.817404+00:00"
"Empress by Boon","False","True","4","It was good but pricey. Probably wouldn’t go again. Paid $140 for tasting menu and a few drinks. Cool experience to have high end vegetarian Chinese food tho","2022-02-24 09:17:30.980540+00:00"
"BAIA","False","True","5","So well executed that people forget it’s vegan. Was mind blowing how they did it. Pizza is okay, but pastas were great. Same level as shizen for Italian. Very nice ambiance. ","2022-02-19 21:40:40.265002+00:00"
"ROOH","False","True","5","High end Indian. Would give 4 stars if SF had better high end Indian restaurants. Pretty pricey because you’ll end up paying $70 per person. This is for a special occasion. Easy to get rez. Last time I went though, naan was disappointing. ","2022-02-19 21:31:48.959793+00:00"
"Che Fico Alimentari","False","True","5","Amazing flavor, cravable Italian, pricey but ambiance is nice. Only downside is that they use a lot of oil and fat in their food. ","2022-02-19 21:21:47.449794+00:00"
"Shizen","False","True","5","As a vegetarian it’s impossible to get sushi that’s worth the money. If you’re craving fish, this isn’t for you. But if you’re open minded, shizen has created their own tasty sub-cuisine of sushi that happens to be vegan. Hard to get reservations. ","2022-02-19 21:29:42.761353+00:00"
"Flour + Water","False","True","5","I’m general skeptical of paying over $20 for pasta because I can make it myself. However, the creativity is what you’re paying for. Higher end, good for special occasions, ambiance is nice. I strongly think the Yelp reviews are wrong on their negative sentiment towards this place. ","2022-02-19 21:24:21.737667+00:00"
"Tilak","False","True","4","Underrated spot for solid North Indian food. Not accessible due to Bernal heights location and not available on delivery apps. Was my go to place when I was living nearby. ","2022-02-19 21:35:42.072671+00:00"
"Beit Rima","False","True","5","Underrated, easy to get into, best middle eastern food in SF. chef is a friend of a friend, professionally trained, and takes feedback very well. Falafel was originally bad, but after I gave feedback, it improved significantly and now it’s amazing. ","2022-02-19 21:42:44.038784+00:00"
"Foreign Cinema","False","True","4","One of my fav brunch places, great ambiance, kind of pricey. Great meal. Good at execution and creativity. ","2022-02-19 21:43:46.672144+00:00"
"Liberty Bagels","False","True","5","Supposedly the best bagel in Manhattan according to this stack rank of every bagel place in the area. https://everythingiseverything.nyc/

Can attest it was very good. Everything bagel with cream cheese came out hot and freshly baked. Highly recommend ","2022-07-10 16:03:52.296288+00:00"
"Saffron Grill","False","True","5","Total underdog, I was surprised at how good this was for that tikka masala + garlic naan craving. The curry was spiceful with great flavor and lots of paneer — no skimping or sad orange color from too much dairy. The naan was well done, supple and delivered hot. Also delivery was insanely fast. Literally 15 mins from order placed to dropped off. Price was solid too, $20 for all including tip. This is my new go-to for PTM. ","2022-05-26 05:55:13.215179+00:00"
"Ippudo","False","True","5","I’ve tried nearly every ramen place, but ippudo is still the best ramen. Broth is lighter, not too oily, not creamy, tofu is very thin, soft boiled egg is great. When I want ramen, ippudo is number 1 for me. Pretty simple to get in and also it’s listed in delivery apps. ","2022-02-19 21:38:06.130391+00:00"
"Il Casaro Pizzeria & Mozzarella Bar","False","True","4","Really good execution of Italian style pizza. Leopard spotting on dough. Cheese and sauce is a little soupy though. At the end of the day solid, reliable, inexpensive pizza. ","2022-02-19 21:18:05.210361+00:00"
"La Colombe Coffee Roasters","False","True","4","This is not a review about actual coffee, but about a coffee - inspired drink. People love the draft latte here. It is great, but IMO Starbucks nitro cold brew with sweet cream has it beat, and it’s more accessible. ","2022-07-10 16:05:42.899718+00:00"
"Hakkasan - San Francisco","False","True","5","Best Americanized Chinese food I’ve had. The mock chicken is my favorite entree of all time. Texture of fake meat tastes so good. Flavors are balanced and it’s not too oily. Generally feels higher end.","2022-02-19 21:15:32.120260+00:00"
