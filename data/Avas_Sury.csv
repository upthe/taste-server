"Gracias Madre","False","True","4","This was a vegan friendly Mexican restaurant that had lots of delicious options. The Fajitas were made with portobello mushrooms and were very tasty. The Chimichanga was also very good.

The one thing that wasn't great was the quesadilla - there was no queso and was made entirely of sweet potatoes üòÇ","2022-09-24 21:28:29.341918+00:00"
