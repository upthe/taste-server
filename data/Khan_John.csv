"Ippudo","False","True","5","Honestly, in the most NY way to describe food: It slaps. The best ramen I’ve had ever. The main chef who creates recipes served us and was enthusiastic for us to try the ramen. I got the spicy tofu and honestly if I could bath in it I would. Sorry I didn’t catch a photo, I ate it too fast.","2022-06-07 00:04:30.538943+00:00"
"King Taqueria","False","True","4","Family owned joint that’s open until 12-2 am most days. Had some of dem seafood tacos and there 1.75 a pop. Quick cheap eats at Lowkey decent quality. Would 100% go again for some late night moves (and I def did go again before I wrote this LOL) ","2022-06-24 18:12:10.910567+00:00"
