"Taqueria 86","False","True","5","We’ve been searching for a burrito that hits the spot- and we finally found it. Salsas are on point, the meat was good quality, ingredients were clean and fresh. We ordered it on ubereats and liked it so much, biked up to the 100s to get it! It’s very unassuming, perfect to grab and enjoy at central park. p.s. don’t sleep on the elote.

"Tavern on the Green","False","True","5","Dinner is nothing special, but the bar with live music on Friday night is perfect old manhattan vibes, especially if you’re ordering a manhattan. Recommend for date night! ","2022-04-16 16:41:06.215859+00:00"
