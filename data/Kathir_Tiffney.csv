"Domaine Carneros","False","True","2","After having been to a couple wineries in the Sonoma and Napa region… these wines are just bad ?? I gave it one bump up from one star because it’s so pretty but meh. Overpriced and def wouldn’t go back","2022-05-31 21:12:12.326678+00:00"
"Experience Burma Restaurant & Bar","False","True","4","Sucker for Burmese so pretty good, but not as good as Burma Superstar. The fiery tofu dish was pretty good but not as spicy as expected","2022-04-29 06:49:52.617652+00:00"
"Mountain High Sandwich Co","False","True","5","Pete explicitly wanted me to give this place 5 stars. Cute sandwich place in Tahoe with excellent veg and vegan options! I despise vegan sandwiches that are just cold veggies and hummus and this place is not that. BBQ tofu was delicious and so was the chocolate mousse","2022-05-21 16:36:51.384165+00:00"
"Plant","False","True","5","I wish I could give this more than 5 stars. We tried half of the menu and it was SO bomb. Supposedly one of the best vegan restaurants in the country and I’d buy it! Our faves were the cheesecake, blondie, ravioli, chile con queso, ramen… ok I could keep going it all really was that good. Also had some highly suspect meat eaters with us and they loved it too!","2022-05-10 02:33:51.459130+00:00"
"Sierra Nevada","False","True","4","Tempeh banh mi was sooo good and an absolute must, best banh mi we’ve had. Both salads were subpar (pasta and Caesar). $$$ but good brewery vibes, views and bocce ball","2022-05-04 14:47:02.435350+00:00"
"Shizen","False","True","5","Great vegan sushi, I get all the hype now. Only get the speciality rolls through or you’ll be disappointed. Our favorite was hidden agenda (tempura and sauces were soo flavorful). Close runner up was surprise ending - a fun Russian roulette type food concept where one of the six pieces of sushi had a spicy twist. Whoever got that piece also got to take the sake shot. I got it and it wasn’t that wildly spicy but definitely elevated the experience! ","2022-06-05 20:34:55.908066+00:00"
"Castello di Amorosa","False","True","5","Sweetest server who kept giving us extra pours, best wines ever, cute vibes (Pete claims it felt like Disneyland for European castles but I’m going to disregard that since the wine was amazing) ","2022-05-31 21:16:22.333150+00:00"
"Blossom Vegan Restaurant","False","True","4","Somewhat conflicted about this place… on one hand it has one of the best tofu dishes I’ve ever had and I would happily eat it forev (jalapeño tofu), but on other hand every other dish is mid. Sooo ya take that for what it is but 100% vegan and prob the best vegan place in the tri valley (still not saying much tho) ","2022-05-29 04:12:41.648247+00:00"
"Laughing Seed Café","False","True","4","Vegan restaurant in Asheville that’s always so crowded! I loved it last time but we just got a miss this go (harvest bowl was too dry). The cauliflower Buffalo tacos were a hit and the reuben","2022-05-04 14:42:55.688905+00:00"
