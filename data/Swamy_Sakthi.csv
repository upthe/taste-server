Falafel pizza was okay - cheese pizza was good, but nothing special. They didn’t give us pita or the dips everyone else was talking about. Halloumi was good but could’ve made the same from halloumi from Safeway. Overall underwhelmed based on all the 5s.

"Che Fico","False","True","4","came with kru kru @kruthi  

Fried risotto was so good (definitely on the smaller size though). Could’ve had three orders of this for dinner and been content.

Pineapple pizza was definitely good, but not the best best pizza ever. Crust was nice because it had parm cheese on top. Also got the blossom squash pasta, which was interesting and worked , but I like flour and water pasta more.

Not sure if I would crave the pizza like I do village square or Tony’s, but definitely a solid spot, but on the pricier end.

Long review because I felt like I have to justify the 4 after @ani glowing 5 star rec.
