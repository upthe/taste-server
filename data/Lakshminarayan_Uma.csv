"Crepes on Cole","False","True","5","Love going here for lunch/brunch! They have both sweet and savory crepes and lots of other options as well. Also a great place to chill and work because they have wifi, lots of natural light, and windows open with fresh air!","2022-05-26 19:54:09.246992+00:00"
"Marufuku Ramen","False","True","4","I always get the vegetable ramen and the broth is super good. Very flavorful! And spinach noodles make me feel healthy even though they‚Äôre probably not. I just wish they added more vegetables and not just a bucket load of arugula. üôÉ","2022-06-02 06:55:12.627946+00:00"
"Robeks Fresh Juices & Smoothies","False","True","5","Always gotta get acai in LA üòã really good, but would be even better if they added more fruit on top","2022-06-20 16:11:18.768651+00:00"
"Piccolo Forno Pizzeria","False","True","4","Tried 4 pastas, in order from best to worst: truffle mushroom ravioli (sooo good), eggplant mozzarella penne, butternut squash ravioli (the oil it was cooked in tasted old), gnocchi with mozzarella and basil (pretty bland)","2022-08-09 07:37:54.874881+00:00"
"Dancing Yak Nepali Cuisine & Bar","False","True","4","My favorite was the paneer cashew curry üòã","2022-08-09 07:34:26.301724+00:00"
"Domino's Pizza","False","True","5","Successfully satisfied my craving üòã always a banger","2022-05-25 04:14:27.366621+00:00"
"Chaat Bhavan","False","True","5","Chaat Bhavan will always hold a special place in my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è this time I tried the paneer tikka masala and the paneer was cooked to perfection üòã","2022-07-01 21:53:30.734480+00:00"
"√âlephante","False","True","5","I‚Äôve heard mixed reviews of this place. Some people say it‚Äôs one of their favorite spots, and some people say it‚Äôs over-hyped and full of influencers. I thought it was really good though, pesto pasta was amazing, views and weather are perfect if you go between late afternoon and sunset.","2022-06-20 16:15:39.759838+00:00"
"Bhoga","False","True","3","Finally got to try this place out with @mihir! Honestly this place started out strong. The shahi paneer and navarathan korma were pretty good, but the low rating is because we randomly saw a FREAKING MOUSE running around the floor near us!!! And the staff did nothing about it and just laughed. So I had to eat with my feet up the whole time and later wondered whether I should have eaten the food at all. But this place is otherwise well-reviewed so I guess it was just a one-time thing. üôÉ Anyway, the menu had a lot of options, both north indian and south indian. There were more gravy dishes than vegetable dishes, but I think it‚Äôs because they are catering to a non indian crowd since they call themselves ‚Äúprogressive indian‚Äù food. Still not sure if I would go back here after that experience lol‚Ä¶","2022-05-26 17:43:01.556499+00:00"
"Cafe Vitale","False","True","4","Bread basket was super fresh and good. I got the mushroom ravioli and taste was pretty good, but the filling was kinda dry. And appetizers were really small so gave it 4 stars.","2022-05-30 18:37:20.568694+00:00"
"Burma Love","False","True","5","This place was packed for a monday night! Tea leaf salad is one of my favorite meals ever. Garlic noodles were amazing too.","2022-06-07 15:43:32.551445+00:00"
"Shizen","False","True","5","","2022-04-16 00:23:07.218369+00:00"
"Starbelly","False","True","5","Really yummy food! My favorites were the elote pizza, cornbread, starbelly salad, and french toast. Only wish their portion sizes were a little bigger because family style was not enough food for everyone!","2022-06-12 23:20:37.942024+00:00"
"Wooden Coffeehouse","False","True","4","They serve Ritual coffee, so really good quality, but I wish the mocha was sweeter! üòÅ Just my preference. The vibe is really cozy. They have these old VHS tapes of classic movies, but they‚Äôve redecorated the covers to add coffee puns into the movie titles.","2022-05-26 21:45:42.504418+00:00"
"H·ªôi An 1608","False","True","4","Lots of vegetarian options! I had the vegan pho and it was pretty good, could have been a bit more flavorful. The portion sizes were huge so definitely worth the price. I would come back to try the veggie bowl.","2022-07-31 05:24:37.581688+00:00"
"Hot Cookie","False","True","5","The cookies are huge and so delicious! They accidentally broke a snickerdoodle they had just made and gave it to us for free. Also the names of the cookies were hilarious (definitely had a theme going on).","2022-07-31 05:26:26.910259+00:00"
"Wildseed","False","True","4","We got the mexican corn cakes, green forest flatbread, neatball masala bowl, and vanilla coconut panna cotta. All the dishes were really good (especially the neatball masala which tasted like malai kofta), and I want to come back to try other dishes. Giving it 4 stars though because it was super expensive!","2022-07-05 20:37:26.383223+00:00"
"Chaat House","False","True","5","I went here a lot growing up, but recently they really impressed me with the food! Really liked how many vegetables they added to the navrathan korma, and the house thali never disappoints.","2022-06-06 16:47:36.482722+00:00"
"Gracias Madre","False","True","4","Food was decent, but gave it 4 stars because it‚Äôs very overpriced. Really liked the elote and almond milk horchata, but the jackfruit tacos were not that good.","2022-07-01 21:48:53.284225+00:00"
"Sestina","False","True","5","I feel like they don‚Äôt advertise it well, but this place is all vegan italian food. The elbows in vodka sauce was SO good‚Äîwe both wished there was more left. I also really liked the tie dye pizza, and the crust was somehow thin and soft.","2022-06-20 16:09:10.850162+00:00"
"Farmhouse Kitchen","False","True","5","The yellow curry is SO good‚Äîwe honestly would have been down to just drink it up in a cup üòã It was a bit frustrating to not have many vegetarian options, but the food quality made up for it.","2022-06-17 05:56:22.019420+00:00"
"Rasa Rasa","False","True","3","The menu definitely mentioned a few vegan items, but I‚Äôd say this food truck isn‚Äôt great for vegetarians. I got the gado gado, which was a mix of vegetables, tofu, and peanut sauce. Unfortunately, it wasn‚Äôt very filling and the tofu was pretty bland.","2022-04-28 16:58:25.614567+00:00"
"Blue Line Pizza","False","True","5","I‚Äôm no expert on deep dish pizza, but I think theirs is excellent. Normally deep dish is so filling and hard to finish, but the individual size pizza is actually perfect for one person. The shishito peppers with their sauce is surprisingly good too. Also, very unhealthy, but life hack is to eat the crust with honey (they keep bottles on hand) üòã","2022-06-06 16:54:02.378115+00:00"
"West of Pecos","False","True","4","Got the smothered breakfast burrito and it was decent! Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm dying to come back here for it though. I‚Äôve heard the puffy tacos are supposed to be good here so maybe just need to try that.","2022-07-24 00:55:40.900433+00:00"
