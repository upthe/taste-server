"Place","Want to taste","Tasted","Rating","Review","Timestamp"
"Van Leeuwen Ice Cream","False","True","4","Had three different flavors, all vegan. The taste of all three was good, but the texture made it obvious it wasn’t real ice cream. Would still recommend as the vegan ice cream was way better than I expected and they offer normal ice cream as well.","2022-07-14 16:12:38.360669+00:00"
"Cafesano","False","True","4","Great ambiance, decent food and price. The grilled chicken parm panini was good, but the chicken shawarma wrap and the fries weren’t that great. I recommend getting the chicken parm panini and the vegetable chips.","2022-05-02 23:22:24.746968+00:00"
"Egg Holic","False","True","5","The place is an Indian street food joint, and I was pleasantly surprised with the food I got. The sandwhich and the pani puri both had great taste, and I loved the crunchy bread of the sandwhich. The mango lassi was a bit over priced but it was solid. 

I debated between a 4 or 5, but I felt that a 4 didn’t do it justice. Will definitely come back to try other items that looked good on their menu.","2022-09-06 04:38:39.324892+00:00"
"Blue Ridge Grill","False","True","3","Food isn’t bad, but definitely not worth the price.","2022-04-05 15:29:41.591310+00:00"
"El Fresco Mexican Grill","False","True","4","Jalapeño poppers were 10/10, the burrito was massive and was easily a solid 4/5. Menu looks promising, will definitely be back again. Good service too.","2022-07-28 02:20:39.077947+00:00"
"Adel's Famous Halal Food","False","True","5","Looked up “Best Halal carts in NYC” and this was the first one to come up - also my first time seeing a cart with a size-able line. Fortunately the line moves quick, and the man taking your order wastes zero time so you’re in and out in a flash once it’s your turn to order.

The food was great, especially for the price. While it’s my first NYC Halal cart experience, I can say I wouldn’t be surprised if it was in fact the best cart of it’s kind in NYC.","2022-05-06 12:06:10.139256+00:00"
"Egg Holic","False","True","5","Came back a second time, to try some new things but couldn’t resist getting the pani puri again - it still slapped.

Their spicy chicken kabob was UNREAL, very tender, juicy, and flavorful. The smothered omelette had way too much gravy and was like a 3/5, but everything else was a 5/5 for sure.","2022-09-11 10:36:54.199360+00:00"
"Sakura Grill Ashburn","False","True","4","Food was solid, the vegetarian miso soup was a pleasant surprise. The hibachi chef cooked the chicken first before the seafood or red meat, so people who don’t eat seafood or red meat would probably like that.

Only complaint (and reason it’s not 5 stars) is that I felt the food could’ve used more spice - I probably should’ve asked for spicier condiments. An all around good experience.","2022-05-18 00:15:31.477568+00:00"
"Totto Ramen","False","True","3","Super disappointed with the ramen I got. Food was a 2/5 but the service was good so I reluctantly gave a 3. The taste itself wasn’t great and the aftertaste was even worse. I saw it listed as the “Best Ramen in Hell’s Kitchen” so either Hell’s Kitchen has a dire need for decent ramen or I was lied to.","2022-05-05 18:59:38.264524+00:00"
"Grazie Grazie","False","True","4","Maybe it’s just because I didn’t eat at all that day until dinner, but I thought the place was decent. The fries and their sauce was fresh. 

The risotto balls were a 2-3/5 though, def don’t get those. The two different sandwiches I tried were a 4/5 - definitely could’ve been a lot better if they weren’t so dry and had more sauce, but the taste was there IMO. ","2022-08-14 06:03:22.689072+00:00"
"Surreal Creamery","False","True","5","Kind of between a 4 and a 5. 5 for the quantity and the creativity of what I had (the chocolate blackout), potentially a 4 simply because the taste of the ice cream didn’t blow me away. Maybe I had my expectations too high and expected Indian quality ice cream or something.
Regardless, there wasn’t anything bad about it so I gave it a 5. 

I had to frantically eat half of it in the store before walking out with the rest so that it wouldn’t end up in shambles like the rest of my life has","2022-07-19 19:28:14.720970+00:00"
"Levain Bakery","False","True","4","A little overhyped, but still worth checking out.","2022-04-03 02:24:09.757665+00:00"
"Baazi","False","True","5","Came here with half the active population of this app, and was debating between a 4 and a 5. The chicken tikka app I split with @skanda was easily a 5, as was the chicken entree @srikanth and I split, minus the minefield of onions I had to carefully navigate through to get to the promised land. I had the virgin Indian summer which was fantastic as well. Good service, definitely recommend.","2022-07-18 01:42:35.256770+00:00"
"Pamplona Va","False","True","4","Had the Spanish fried chicken and it was good, zero complaints. Only didn’t give a five since it didn’t rock my socks off, but I definitely recommend giving this place a shot (it’s more of a small plates and drinks spot).

I’m coming for my Emerald spot back @muthu !!","2022-07-08 02:10:47.559838+00:00"
"Our Mom Eugenia","False","True","3","Debated between a 3 and a 4 - there’s nothing wrong with the place by any means, but the food didn’t really wow me… except the pita bread which was amazing. 

I had the Greek salad and chicken skewers and the taste for both was fine, but nothing out of this world. Service was good though.","2022-05-11 20:38:56.419234+00:00"
"Compass Rose Bar + Kitchen","False","True","4","Great ambiance and service but the food wasn’t crazy good, just normal. The menu features meals from around the world which is cool I guess","2022-07-21 04:10:25.209815+00:00"
"Spicy Moon","False","True","5","I had the Dan Dan noodles and two non alcoholic drinks: a lychee ginger beer one and a soda mixed with their house made raspberry berry syrup. 

The noodles didn’t really cater to my specific tastes but were still good, and the Google reviews raved about them so I’m pretty sure I’m just a weirdo. The drinks were great, the portion size for the noodles given their cost was great. I’ll definitely come back to try other things on their menu, everything looked good. 

The place is completely vegetarian and they gave me the option of adding Impossible Beef to the noodles but I proceeded with just the normal noodles. Good service too. ","2022-07-18 20:33:44.544206+00:00"
"George's King Of Falafel & Cheesesteak","False","True","5","Great food for the price and speed. A little cramped inside but not surprising given it’s in Georgetown. A fantastic late night option. I’ve been twice, once as a vegetarian and once as a chicken eater and had a great experience both times.","2022-05-24 01:33:03.820650+00:00"
"Peri Peri Original","False","True","5","The Buffalo Chicken Sandwich was unbelievably good, as were the potato wedges and garlic bread. 10/10 must try spot!","2022-04-12 20:24:25.622315+00:00"
"Courthouse Kabob","False","True","5","Probably the best kabobs this side of the Mississippi. Reasonable price, great service, and phenomenal food. Every aspect, from the naan to the Chicken, was amazing. An absolute must try for anyone in the area!","2022-05-01 02:36:28.329687+00:00"
"Mom's Kitchen & Bar","False","True","5","Great food and service. Huge portion sizes and the shake was good too. The fried chicken sandwhich was especially good","2022-07-17 20:58:58.606339+00:00"
"Grace Street","False","True","4","The churro waffle was great, definitely worth trying. The Cookie Monster was mostly shaved ice so it didn’t have much flavor. The overall atmosphere was great.","2022-05-06 02:59:50.377722+00:00"
"My Thai Place Restaurant","False","True","1","The soup was rancid.","2022-06-27 19:58:51.091737+00:00"
"Pueblos Tex Mex Grill","False","True","4","Overall solid, yet typical Tex Mex. Nothing wrong but nothing special. I wish they brought out spicier salsas for the chips.","2022-05-16 01:29:46.795532+00:00"
"TNR Cafe","False","True","4","Bubble tea here is solid, I had a great time coming here before with the mango black tea.

Decided to eat here this time and got the vegetable lo mein- which would’ve been completely fine if it wasn’t so salty. I’m guessing they accidentally put too much soy sauce in the dish but IDK. I also tried the strawberry black tea which was good, but I think I prefer the mango.

All in all I’d say the bubble tea is a 4 or 5, my food experience was a 3.","2022-08-20 01:33:22.411116+00:00"
"Empanada Mama","False","True","5","The spicy chicken empanadas are addicting, proceed either caution.","2022-04-03 02:24:58.410961+00:00"
"Sacco Pizza","False","True","5","After @maaz’s review I had to try this place again to make sure I’m not crazy… and I’m not. I had the cheese slice again (with a healthy amount of red pepper flakes) and it was phenomenal. Great price, speed, and service, I absolutely recommend.","2022-07-14 16:13:53.804083+00:00"
"Red Rooster Harlem","False","True","5","Great vibes and service, the wings were phenomenal. The fries and mac and cheese were really good too, as were the drumsticks. Don’t get the fried chicken sandwhich, it didn’t have much flavor. Will definitely try to come back again!","2022-12-08 13:02:24.401032+00:00"
"Bodo's Bagels","False","True","4","A bit overhyped in my opinion but the food was good and the line moved VERY fast. The jalapeño lime cream cheese is subtly flavored so it probably goes well with most things.

That being said I can understand why it’s a staple at UVA, I can see myself coming here fairly often as a student.","2022-10-10 16:12:50.883080+00:00"
"Tonchin","False","True","5","The vegan ramen was amazing, and they were kind enough to entertain my “no onion or scallion” request despite the menu saying no modifications. 

The food came pretty fast too, and the staff were very nice and helpful. I definitely will try to visit again next time I’m in NYC.","2022-05-10 02:18:13.258799+00:00"
"Liberty Bagels","False","True","5","They let you sample the cream cheese spreads which is sick (like an ice cream parlor). The jalapeño and the strawberry were the only two I tried but both were great. 

The bagels are a lot bigger than I expected so I was only able to eat the strawberry one (which was great), will have to save the jalapeño for tomorrow. 

Kind staff and fast service, I definitely recommend.","2022-07-16 17:45:51.516837+00:00"
"The Kati Roll Company","False","True","5","Stumbled across this place on Google while seeing what’s still open. I had the in-house mango lassi, in-house chips, the chicken tikka Kati roll, and the chicken momos (basically dumplings).

The lassi and chips were great, but I felt the lassi was a bit overpriced for how much you got. The tikka roll was amazing, but I wish they’d specify they shove a lot of onion in there, as it wasn’t listed under the ingredients. The momos were good with the dipping sauces, but didn’t have much taste without the sauces. 

Overall a place definitely worth checking out, but doesn’t give as much food as you’d think.","2022-05-08 02:24:30.161448+00:00"
"El Fresco Mexican Grill","False","True","4","Chicken tortilla soup was decent but nothing to write home about. Chicken nachos were great, highly recommend. As always, the jalapeño poppers were a straight 10/10.","2022-08-12 04:36:37.660376+00:00"
"Summer Salt","False","True","5","Better chipotle.","2022-07-16 02:20:51.554040+00:00"
"Wu's Wonton King","False","True","4","Came here with @maaz and @skanda. The general tso’s and sesame chicken were fire, the mapo tofu was NOT. I could see myself giving this place a 5 if we only kept to the pan fried noodles and the two above mentioned chicken dishes… and if we were ever served water like Skanda mentioned.","2022-07-17 15:57:22.460330+00:00"
"Mi Vida","False","True","5","Had the nachos, chicken tacos, and the virgin… something, I already forgot. Everything was amazing though, highly recommend (it’s a bit pricey but worth coming to at least once IMO).","2022-08-20 18:01:32.456117+00:00"
"The Kati Roll Company","False","True","5","","2022-05-08 02:21:23.743464+00:00"
"Rubirosa Ristorante","False","True","5","Great tie dye pizza and service!","2022-04-03 02:23:32.338767+00:00"
"Brooklyn Pizza Masters","False","True","5","Looked up nearby places to eat and this struck my eye because of its ratings on Google. 

I had the Buffalo chicken, Sicilian, and vodka sauce and all three were good. The garlic knots looked good too but I chose to get a third slice instead of the knots. It’s not as good as Sacco’s but it was good, light, square pizza.","2022-07-14 19:51:12.180524+00:00"
"Pitango Gelato","False","True","5","The chocolate hazelnut gelato is 5/5. Very rich and creamy and flavorful. The strawberry sorbet was also really good, but I’d give it a 4/5 simply because it wasn’t as good. An overall solid spot, and it’s nice to walk around and enjoy the RTC a vibes while eating the gelato.","2022-05-16 01:31:28.521903+00:00"
"District Chicken & Gyro","False","True","5","Very limited menu but great food. Their red and white sauce go perfectly with their chicken rice and salad, and my parents enjoyed their falafel as well (despite the fact that the falafel was microwaved in front of my face…???)

Anyways, definitely worth checking out, it’s basically good NYC halal kart food but available in NoVA.","2022-06-05 05:25:55.821930+00:00"
"Carve Unique Sandwiches","False","True","4","I had a slice of the Buffalo chicken pizza, which was solid but definitely more expensive than I anticipated. There were other appealing pizza options as well, so I may revisit another time. They reheat the slice for you in a pizza oven which is cool. I also had an overpriced orange juice which wasn’t worth getting, but it still tasted good. I hope the sandwiches are better bang for the buck than the pizza slices are.","2022-05-05 03:07:44.044951+00:00"
"Ravagh Persian Grill","False","True","4","The appetizer (basically Persian dumplings) and the complimentary pita + sauce are a 5/5, the chicken kabob I had was a 4/5 (large amount of rice, chicken wasn’t as flavorful as I thought it would be). A tad expensive but worth going to just for the appetizer.","2022-07-14 16:11:12.464223+00:00"
"Black Hog BBQ","False","True","4","Had the wings here - they have four or five flavors, of which I’ve tried 3: the Buffalo, dry rub, and mustard. I liked all 3, but outside the wings they only had a half or whole chicken as the chicken options. 

Friendly staff and nice place, might end up going back at some point down the road.","2022-09-02 01:14:10.280117+00:00"
"Sacco Pizza","False","True","5","Probably couldn’t be better for what it’s meant to be - a good cheap slice of authentic NY pizza. I went with an original slice of cheese since I was still reeling from the travesty that was Totto Ramen. I’ll definitely come back again if I’m in the area, and I highly suggest you do the same.","2022-05-05 19:46:48.575430+00:00"
"Duck Donuts","False","True","3","Perhaps I just don’t have a sophisticated enough sweet tooth but it felt like I was just eating raw sugar. I had the cookies and cream donut as well as the s’mores donut and couldn’t even tell which was which. Unfortunate that I just shaved off a few months of my life expectancy for this
","2022-05-25 21:29:01.812080+00:00"
"Village Square Pizza","False","True","4","Came here with @ani and he recommended the white pizza, which was a good call. We drizzled hot honey over the slices and it came out great. If I wasn’t so full from earlier I could maybe see myself giving this place a 5","2022-07-15 15:12:10.691781+00:00"
"Saar Indian Cuisine & Bar","False","True","4","The black pepper chicken and the jalapeño and cheese samosas were a 5, and I really liked the kadai mushroom too but only had one piece so I can’t confidently give it a 5.

The chicken biryani and the chicken korma weren’t as good IMO. Overall solid experience, but by no means the best Indian food I’ve had.","2022-12-05 01:43:31.531774+00:00"
"2 Bros Pizza","False","True","4","I was skeptical after having a horrific experience at the FiDi location last year, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good the pizza was here, and all for roughly a dollar a slice.","2022-05-08 06:13:16.397714+00:00"
"V{IV}","False","True","5","Ironically ran into @skanda completely by coincidence here when I came to pick up lunch,

I had the chicken drunken noodles, and asked them to make it spicy, to which they obliged after kindly asking if I was sure I wanted Thai spicy. The spice was a lot but it was good for my taste. The noodles were very flavorful, I had zero complaints about my meal. Possibly the best drunken noodles I’ve had, although I’ve admittedly only been to a few places.","2022-07-14 16:17:53.045683+00:00"
"Los Tacos No. 1","False","True","4","Was debating between a four and a five. The tacos were great, especially for takeout standards. I had the corn tacos (they also offer flour ones but I’m not a heathen), with chicken guacamole and salsa. They also give you the option of adding cilantro and onions, which I didn’t pursue. Although a tad expensive, the food is def worth trying and the food was made fresh and fast right in front of me. Not a lot of options, but a classic example of quality over quantity. I definitely recommend checking this place out at night when other options are closed. ","2022-05-05 03:05:26.339284+00:00"
"Route 66","False","True","4","Had the Buffalo chicken wrap and fries - solid meal, no complaints other than the server asking @skanda how well we wanted his… turkey burger done…","2022-07-14 16:09:04.511289+00:00"
"Courthouse Kabob","False","True","5","Took home a chicken kabob plate, chicken shawarma plate, and a falafel plate for my parents.

Everyone in my family loved it. I’m not a huge fan of falafel in general but I had one of the pieces and it might genuinely be the first time I had falafel and noticed it actually had a taste on its own. The other kabobs were amazing too, but I preferred the chicken kabob to the chicken shawarma (although you get a lot more chicken with the shawarma). Glad to see that the place’s quality extends throughout its menu whilst maintaining a very reasonable price.","2022-05-16 03:40:36.860803+00:00"
"Château de Chantilly","False","True","4","Great vibes, overrated desserts. It gets bonus points for being open until 11 PM though, a truly rare sight in NoVA.","2022-05-24 00:58:14.870407+00:00"
"The Qui Korean Grille","False","True","5","Best KBBQ I’ve had, and while that isn’t saying much since I’ve only been to a few, the Chicken was easily some of the best I had in a while. ","2022-05-24 01:31:20.696409+00:00"
