"Paisano's Pizza","False","True","4","Ordered for delivery. I loved the dough they used as it gave for a slight chew to their crust. It was expensive (~$20 for a large veg) which makes it a less casual pizza. I may prefer places like Mellow at this price point. ","2022-09-02 20:23:45.648765+00:00"
"Ninth Street Espresso","False","True","4","Relaxing atmosphere. Good coffee. Affordable price. More of a grab and go place than a place you’d do some work at due to lack of seating. ","2022-06-21 23:16:35.200688+00:00"
"Secret Sandwich Society","False","True","4","Must get the Pimento cheese fries - they are bomb. The fried chicken patty was a little bland. I’ve been here before and enjoyed their sandwiches. I’m also recovering from COVID so my taste may be a little subdued. ","2022-07-16 14:13:58.738008+00:00"
"Dominique Ansel Workshop","False","True","5","Went with Ani - he hyped it up and it lived up to the expectations. The olive oil breakfast sandwich was delicious ","2022-06-20 20:40:47.899591+00:00"
"Carytown Burgers & Fries","False","True","3","Food was mediocre. Will fill you up. Ambiance kinda lame. Servers were nice for our legs party. Money could be spent elsewhere","2022-07-16 14:15:47.461522+00:00"
"Kailash Parbat","False","True","3","Mixed opinion. Chole batura and mixed chaat were great. Not too oily as some restaurants can get. The chaat platter was supposed to be a variety but tasted very uniform. Avoid the paneer lalfreez if you don’t like spice. It was also very pricey and service was average. ","2022-06-21 03:11:40.387717+00:00"
"JewFro","False","True","5","What an interesting combination of food and flavor. JewFro takes a classy approach to Jewish African flavors. We thoroughly enjoyed the appetizers and entree. It is more of a bougie restaurant but the vibes were very hipster and eclectic. The lunch menu looks great too! Will definitely be back ","2022-07-16 14:11:27.219684+00:00"
"Hangry Joes Hot Chicken","False","True","5","Great Nashville hot chicken - I got the medium spice and it still had a kick. They had some Korean nuggets and tenders that also looked appetizing. Will definitely be going back","2022-06-25 03:24:14.928814+00:00"
"Thai Villa","False","True","4","Food was solid and affordable but felt like I missing some subtle flavor notes I’ve had at other Thai places. The vibes were great with picturesque chandeliers and nice wood walls","2022-06-20 02:05:11.405158+00:00"
"Bottoms Up","False","True","3","The pizza was okay - a large can feed you 4 meals but it was pretty expensive ($30). Flavors were nothing amazing. No real aesthetic to the pizza either","2022-07-18 00:11:08.947680+00:00"
"Del Vecchios","False","True","5","Del Vecchios is solid Italian food that is filling for cheap. I ordered the lasagna and @kaivalya got the meatball sub and we both had enough for left overs. Not really a place to take a date but great to order in. Will be back to check out their pizza!","2022-09-09 21:23:24.292960+00:00"
"Taqueria Gramercy","False","True","4","Tacos (carnitas and chorizo) well sized and affordable . Guac and chips were fresh and delicious. ","2022-06-21 00:51:32.491644+00:00"
"Liberty Public House","False","True","5","Excellent brunch options at an affordable price. Was stuffed like my other table goers and we all had stuff to take home ","2022-06-26 04:44:43.583745+00:00"
"Town Center Cold Pressed - Norfolk","False","True","4","I got the Reboot - a beet based drink. I have a hard time justifying $8 for juice. It was good but not something I would go to again. ","2022-08-20 23:28:48.883435+00:00"
"Chorizo Mexican Eatery","False","True","4","Some great Mexican food! I went with @kaivalya 

Pushpak - 4 Tacos with Chorizo, Brisket, Carnitas, and Barbacoa. I enjoyed the Chorizo and Carnitas the most!

Kala - Enchiladas with Brisket with rice and beans. 

I really enjoyed the beans - wish I got it as a side. 

The only annoying part was they aren’t upfront with their pricing ","2022-08-20 23:26:39.681498+00:00"
"Ladybird","False","True","5","As someone who eats meat this was ideal vegan food! Had the chicken and waffles (new item!), bacon egg and cheese, and grilled cheese and they were all so good! I’d skip the whipped coffee as it was too pricy. Servers were fantastic, especially when dealing with a billing issue","2022-06-20 02:27:58.628130+00:00"
"Da Andrea Restaurant","False","True","4","Good Italian food but I had a hard time being impressed. The appetizers are pretty pricy for the value. The entrees were well made and filling. ","2022-06-20 02:08:34.207669+00:00"
"Soul Taco","False","True","3","The food looks appetizing but I just feel like over the years the flavor has gotten bleh. I really think their best taco is their fried chicken. Did not enjoy their carnitas or catfish that much. Their lunch deal 3 for $11 is a good buy. ","2022-09-02 20:26:21.325580+00:00"
"Pies & Pints","False","True","4","Bougie pizza that has solid flavors. It’s like Mellow Mushroom prices and flavors are unique. Pictured are Street Corn, Black Bean, and Hot Mamma. Ambience was kinda weird bc it was so dead but food was good and I would definitely return! ","2022-08-27 13:58:31.032864+00:00"
"Wondee Siam","False","True","5","Felt like a hole in the wall but best chicken satay and drunken noodles I’ve had. Skip the curry as it was pretty watery. Good portions and affordable!","2022-06-20 02:10:41.335975+00:00"
"Mama Cucina","False","True","5","Unassuming Italian place with killer food with huge portion sizes for an affordable price (lunch deal!!). Great service. I got the Rigatoni Rosa and Chicken Francese and both were excellent","2022-06-23 17:33:46.722466+00:00"
"Fair Grounds News & Coffee","False","True","4","Tasty coffee with comparable 
 pricing to Starbucks. Ample space to study and the vibes were nice. I would come back!","2022-08-20 23:29:46.342318+00:00"
