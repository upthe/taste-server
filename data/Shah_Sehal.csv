"Planta","False","True","5","tbh we only come here for the sushi!! go on mondays for the $8 maki roll deal & order all the sushi! torched press (MY FAVORITE i crave it all the time), crispy rice, & rainbow rolls are the best. besides the sushi, everything else is mediocreâ€¦ except the banginâ€™ broccoli which is lowkey banginâ€™ ","2022-05-14 05:41:40.989927+00:00"
"Chinese Tuxedo","False","True","4","super cool ambiance! drinks are good :) itâ€™s right next door to peachyâ€™s &  apotheke, which are my fave bars in chinatown. i ordered the sweet potato curry spring rolls (gave me samosa vibes) & spicy mi goreng (peanut noodles) which are both delicious. but i also got the crispy eggplant ?? or some asparagus dish that was so salty and made my stomach hurt :/","2022-05-14 16:08:30.407821+00:00"
