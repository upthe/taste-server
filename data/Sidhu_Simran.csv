"Ryujin Ramen House","False","True","5","I religiously eat here once a week. Best ramen in the greater Sacramento area for sure, probably beats most Bay Area ramen restaurants too. Wait time can be long, especially for dinner time around 7-9pm. Go there after 9pm, super fast and friendly service. ","2022-04-18 18:36:02.779055+00:00"
"Midtown's Cantina Alley","False","True","5","Tacos are the highlight here, definitely get a mix and match of Baja, carne asada, and carnitas tacos. Drinks are amazing and there is also a virgin mangoneada slush that is just as good! Some vegan/vegetarian options available too! Very loud restaurant with the music blasting and all outdoor seating under shade. Great for food before a night out! ","2022-04-21 06:18:33.967020+00:00"
"Matador Room","False","True","4","Ordered the steak and the chicken tacos. The chimichuri sauce was good but the steak could have been better (ordered it medium rare). The room itself is nice, very classy. Service is great.  ","2022-05-21 15:49:19.081413+00:00"
"ChoLon - Downtown","False","True","5","BEST Brussels sprouts I’ve ever had! Very hard veggie to get right and this restaurant has nailed the taste! It’s a modern Asian fusion restaurant and have dim sum options as well. Great ambiance and located in downtown Denver. ","2022-06-13 02:05:47.887060+00:00"
"Cafe Dantorels","False","True","3","Went here two separate times. Tried the California burger and the grilled chicken sandwich. The food is great at first but starts tasting bland the more you bite into it. The ambiance is great, always plenty of seating. Great for doing brunch with family and friends.

"Drake’s BARN","False","True","5","Best wood fire oven pizza I’ve had. Great open outdoor space for groups of family, friends, and dog lovers. Grab a lawn chair and sit by the fire pits with great drinks and pizza. ","2022-08-01 19:30:04.883793+00:00"
