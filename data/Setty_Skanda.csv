"Angolino Pizza","False","True","4","This place is a small pizza joint that’s open till almost 3am on the weekends and located next to a couple of bars…it’s late night, drunk food. That being said, it really hit the spot. I might’ve been a bit biased, but everything about the pizza was really good except the sauce. It was really sweet…reminded me of the sauce on a Chuck E Cheese pizza. Also it’s really expensive—the slice of cheese pizza was about $5","2022-08-15 11:58:26.152557+00:00"
"Au Za’atar","False","True","3","I wish I had taken a picture of the Spicy Hummus appetizer because that was easily the best part of the meal. The appetizer was a plate of hummus which I enjoyed, some garlic aioli (which was also good), some pickled vegetables, and pita bread. I wasn’t expecting much out of the pickled vegetables, but the pickled radish was really good. It had a great balance of acidity and flavor. The pita bread was nice because it was made fresh, and it was free so it just kept coming. If all I had was the appetizer, I would’ve given this place 5 stars.

For the entree, I ordered the Chicken Kafta Kebab. The fries were seasoned nicely, but the kebab was the issue. It wasn’t bad, but it lacked in flavor a bit and was a little dry. I think the most disappointing thing, though, was that today happened to be the day that they didn’t have the mini tabletop shawarma where you get to cut the meat yourself.","2022-06-24 22:09:29.705415+00:00"
"El Vez","False","True","5","If you’ve been led astray by the dry, bland meat strings that Chipotle passes off as Carnitas, try the Carnitas Tacos here and prepare to have your mind blown. The meat has in these tacos have such a strong porky flavor and the blobs of rendered fat are meaty and delicious. I’m really not much of a tacos guy (I prefer a good burrito) but I’d take the Carnitas Tacos here any day. Fair warning, it’s a bit oily. ","2022-05-16 02:06:20.187738+00:00"
"Rowdy Rooster","False","True","4","Despite the fact that spice level 4 (on a scale of 1-5) completely kicked my ass while eating the food and  for the rest of the day, I still enjoyed the sandwich. I got the Big Rowdy. It’s a good chicken sandwich and the meat isn’t over cooked or dry. It’s topped with a mint chutney, yogurt (apparently…I don’t remember any of that), and onions. I’m giving this place 4 stars, but you could totally make a case for 3. If you think about it, it’s not that special. The toppings are pretty simple and the spice doesn’t come from some unique spicy sauce. As you increase the spice level they just add more and more of some spicy masala powder.

"Delhi 6","False","True","4","It’s a solid Indian restaurant. I had the kadai paneer and the paneer makhani. The kadai paneer was very flavorful, but I thought the paneer makhani was a bit flat and one dimensional. I might be nitpicking because overall it’s solid, no huge complaints","2022-05-10 13:10:23.133428+00:00"
"Baazi","False","True","5","If you see 10 different reviews of this place pop up on your feed, feel free to skip this one. We all ate the same things, and I didn’t even take pictures.

The Kasoori Methi Chicken Tikka (appetizer) was fantastic. It was very flavorful and it was really tender. It also had that smoky flavor you get from grilling meat. The presentation was also really cool (they light the whole thing on fire). I wish they could just increase the portion size and make this an entree.

The Paneer Sirka Pyaaz (entree) was good. I’d say the flavor is pretty similar to Kadai Paneer. I have no complaints about this dish. I definitely want to call out the pickled onions in this dish. They were delicious—great flavor and great amount of acidity. I never thought an Indian restaurant would go out of their way to make the onions in a dish taste good.

Overall I could make a case for 4 stars—the entree didn’t live up to the appetizer, the portions are relatively small, the prices are relatively high—but I really enjoyed the food and had a good time, so I’m rounding up to 5.","2022-07-18 01:39:19.917119+00:00"
"sweet","False","True","4","They almost exclusively sell cupcakes here. There’s a bunch of different flavors but my favorite is “Black Bottom” which is half chocolate cake, half cheesecake. I got one of those and one “Chocolate” (chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream frosting). I’m not a huge fan of buttercream, but let’s be honest—it’s a cupcake, it’s going to taste good. I do enjoy picking up cupcakes from this place, but I won’t give it 5 stars because I’ve had better specialty cupcakes elsewhere.","2022-07-29 03:40:14.540644+00:00"
"Ramen Nagomi","False","True","4","Man this is tough. I went here with a few other people, and if I go off what they felt about their ramen and even some of the components of my ramen, I’d rate this place as 5 stars. Honestly though, I just didn’t see the hype. 

Tonkotsu ramen is my go-to at most ramen places but I decided to try the Tori Paitan ramen—a chicken broth based ramen. It had good chicken flavor, but I just wasn’t blown away. The rest of the ramen was good though, and I appreciate that they went light on the toppings. The pork chashu was cooked well and even had some char. The egg was interesting. I liked the flavor of the yolk—it had this almost sweetness to it. Also the yolk isn’t runny, it’s custard-like. The noodles were good too and had a nice chew (although I think I’ve had better). 

I just can’t get over the broth being underwhelming. Maybe I should’ve had their Tonkotsu ramen and maybe this place is worth 5 stars, but I just can’t say that with any certainty.","2022-05-29 14:14:27.077578+00:00"
"Adel's Famous Halal Food","False","True","4","I am cursed. Every time I go to this food cart I wait in line for what feels like hours. It’s a mind-numbing test of patience that wears me down. Don’t come here after midnight unless you want to be trapped in this actual real life genjutsu. The line moves so slow it’s unbearable. They need to get a second cart. 

Alright rant over. The food here is really good. I got chicken over rice this time but I like the falafel over rice better. The white sauce on top tastes good and the red sauce has some kick to it which I liked. If you get the chicken over rice they give you so much meat (I’d honestly prefer a bit less meat and more rice). Overall I’d probably give this place 5 stars since it’s such a good solid halal food cart, but a little part of me dies every time I wait in that line.","2022-07-16 18:14:17.898579+00:00"
"Jollibee","False","True","3","I finally tried Jollibee, the Filipino fast food chain. I had heard good things, so maybe my expectations were too high (which is why I’m torn between 3 and 4 stars). I got the Spicy Chicken Sandwich and a side of fries. The fries are similar to McDonalds or Wendy’s fries. The chicken sandwich was fine. They put a lot of that orange sauce which I appreciate and instead of pickles, they put jalapeño slices which I really liked. The chicken itself was really dense and heavy for some reason. It certainly wasn’t bad and I have no regrets, but I’d still take Chick Fil A or Popeyes over this.","2022-07-29 20:57:04.870035+00:00"
"Otto Strada","False","True","4","The Espresso Short Rib Ravioli was pretty good, but adding a bit of espresso powder on top is a weird addition. The sauce was a butter/Parmesan sauce so it’s thinner than the cheesier sauces that I’m used to (and prefer). Thankfully it wasn’t just 3 or 4 pieces of ravioli. The Rigatoni Alla Vodka was better. The sauce was creamy and it did taste like vodka sauce except the tomato flavor was more pronounced than I expected. I really liked that the pasta itself was cooked al dente (extra points in my book). I wouldn’t recommend the Tiramisu here. It’s not bad, but there’s a strong almond flavor throughout the cake. This was my second time coming here. I really like the food here, but it’s just not good enough to give it 5 stars, especially since it’s expensive (every pasta dish is $20-30).","2022-07-31 20:26:55.933737+00:00"
"Kati Thai Cuisine","False","True","4","I wanted to give this place a 3 because I felt misled, but the food was still good so I’ll give it a 4. I ordered the Spicy Basil Fried Rice. They don’t let you choose a spice level. The color of the rice surprised me—it was pale not brown like I expected. It looked just like regular Thai Fried Rice. The sauce they used when they made the rice definitely wasn’t the sweet/savory Thai basil sauce normally used in Spicy Basil Fried Rice dishes. My dish still tasted good and it was flavorful, but it felt like it was missing something. Maybe they did just mess up my order and bring my regular Thai Fried Rice.","2022-07-24 23:13:21.525621+00:00"
"That's Amore","False","True","4","Before we got to the restaurant, we were told that this place is a tourist trap but it’s still pretty good. I got the Margherita Pizza, and honestly I think that’s a pretty good description. The Margherita pizza looked like a regular cheese/marinara pizza but it was sort of in the shape of a heart (a reference to the name of the restaurant, maybe). It tasted good—no complaints here but it’s a pretty basic pizza.

If you’re looking for authenticity, I’m not really sure if this place is or isn’t authentic. The pizza clearly wasn’t but when I looked at their menu, their Carbonara uses guanciale (which is traditional) while many other places in Italy skimp out and just use bacon instead.","2022-06-08 16:15:38.872346+00:00"
"Levain Bakery","False","True","5","They have a new (or relatively new) flavor called Two Chip Chocolate Chip. It’s a chocolate chip cookie with semi-sweet and dark chocolate chips and no nuts. It’s simple, but I think it’s my favorite. Anyways, the cookies here are great. They’re giant, fat cookies, and my favorite part is how the middle is this big chewy chunk of cookie. One day I hope to come and get a cookie that’s fresh out of the oven—I bet they’re even better when it’s a bit softer on the outside.

**The cookies are big by the way. No shame if you share one with a friend, but no judgement if you can finish one by yourself**","2022-07-14 20:21:20.159162+00:00"
"Wu's Wonton King","False","True","4","I played it safe and got the General Tso’s Chicken. I thought it was pretty good—maybe even better than your usual takeout General Tso’s Chicken. It’s sweet (which is expected) but it’s not as overwhelming sweet as the takeout alternative. I definitely wouldn’t say it’s spicy, but they did try to tone the sweetness down with a tiny bit of heat. The only problems I had with it (and the restaurant) were 1) the portion size was smaller than I expected 2) it didn’t come with rice and 3) they didn’t even serve us a glass of water.","2022-07-17 15:32:30.468954+00:00"
"LumLum","False","True","5","It’s a great, solid Thai restaurant (with an appropriate 4.9 stars on Google reviews). I ordered the Pad See Ew (basically drunken noodles) and it tasted really good. The sauce was flavorful and the noodles and chicken really absorbed that flavor. I wish the portion size was a bit larger, but otherwise no complaints from me.","2022-07-16 21:26:04.519155+00:00"
"Natta Thai Cuisine","False","True","3","We got the Papaya Salad, Natta Thai Fried Rice, Crispy Duck, and Wild Pork. The Papaya Salad was sweet, just as I like it. The Natta Thai Fried Rice was similar to basil fried rice dishes from other Thai places. It definitely needed salt though. I can’t say too much about the Crispy Duck since I’m not a huge fan of duck. It came with this sweet, tangy sauce that my brother said tasted like a Chinese sweet and sour sauce. The Wild Pork also had an interesting sauce. It wasn’t bad, but I would’ve enjoyed it a lot more if it was similar to the sauce from a Kaprow dish. Overall, most of the food wasn’t bad, it just wasn’t for me.","2022-08-16 03:11:49.275414+00:00"
"Wondee Siam","False","True","3","I ordered the Crispy Pork Basil which I assumed was the pork version of Crispy Chicken with Thai Basil—a dish I really enjoy that I’ve had at a couple Thai places in Nova. For the most part I was right. It’s pieces of pork cooked with red bell peppers and garlic in a sweet/savory Thai Basil sauce. It’s a really flavorful dish that can also be spicy if you request it, but the pork version is a serious downgrade from the chicken version. The pork pieces are just way too chewy. If you’ve ever had a pork belly dish at a Chinese place then you know the texture of the meat is really chewy. Before ordering, I had my suspicions that the texture would be like this, but I risked it and paid the price. If you’re interested in this dish, go to some other Thai place and get the chicken version (they only have the pork one here).","2022-07-15 17:53:34.043956+00:00"
"il Laboratorio Del Gelato","False","True","4","It’s gelato, so there’s not much to complain about. It’s good, but the portion sizes are smaller here than the gelato places in Italy. They have a bunch of flavors here (but Tiramisu isn’t one of them smh). Dulce de leche is really good, but Dark chocolate is a bit of a miss. ","2022-08-21 15:22:30.704605+00:00"
"Skylark Diner & Lounge","False","True","3","This might’ve been ranked as the best diner in NJ by Food Network, but I found it pretty average. The crispy chicken sandwich was pretty dry and the chicken itself wasn’t seasoned very much. It could’ve definitely used some sauce and I don’t mean the little bit of balsamic vinegar they put on the bottom. The sweet potato fries were good but they were a bit too sweet.","2022-05-28 21:17:41.696020+00:00"
"Amiya","False","True","4","I ordered takeout this time. I got the Malibu Murgh again, but it wasn’t as good as it was last time. The chicken was a bit over cooked and it wasn’t as spicy as last time. The naan was a bit too bread-y this time. I think it needed to be thinner and crispier. The food was still good, it just wasn’t 5/5 this time.","2022-09-11 16:30:21.236094+00:00"
"Wiseguy Pizza","False","True","5","Washington DC might not be known for their pizza, but Wiseguy Pizza is my go-to pizza joint in DC. They have many different flavors of pizza, but my favorite is the buffalo chicken because it’s half buffalo sauce, half ranch sauce","2022-05-07 00:37:39.608131+00:00"
"Umai Ramen & Rice Bowl","False","True","5","After going to multiple ramen places, I’m ready to accept that no place is perfect—including this one—so despite its flaws I really enjoyed the Tonkotsu Ramen here. Before I explain what won me over, I’ll point out some things I didn’t like.

1. The “black fungus” is wood ear mushrooms. I suppose it’s common with this type of ramen. They’re usually soft and spongy but here they were kind of dry and had a weird texture
2. I’ve had much better noodles elsewhere. The good noodles are springy and bouncy and have a satisfying bite, but the noodles here are very average

With that out of the way, here’s what really won me over and why I’m giving this place 5 stars:
1. The broth was so rich and and fatty and it was very flavorful. I could definitely taste the pork in the broth and it had an almost roasted flavor
2. The pork chashu was cooked perfectly. The meat was so tender it was basically falling apart. I haven’t had pork chashu like that in ramen in a long time. It’s weird to say but this is probably what sold me on the 5 star rating

~I will say though that some of the people I went with weren’t as impressed with the ramen they got so maybe it’s hit or miss here~","2022-05-25 13:01:20.638863+00:00"
"Turning Point","False","True","4","I got the Grand French (3 thick slices of French toast on brioche bread).  There’s no special toppings, it’s just some good French toast. It comes with a side of potatoes. The potatoes are really good—probably because they’re pretty salty. This place keeps all their maple syrup in those tall, skinny olive oil dispensers, making it impossible to pour out a reasonable amount of syrup. I didn’t try the Plain Belgian waffle, but it looked pretty dry to me.","2022-07-31 20:12:03.741621+00:00"
"Mah-Ze-Dahr Bakery","False","True","4","I got a slice of their cheesecake, and it’s a tough call whether this place should get 4 or 5 stars. I’m giving it 4 stars, but I can easily see the cheesecake aficionados giving it 5. Maybe my palate just isn’t advanced enough to really see the difference between “really good” cheesecake and “good” cheesecake. 

To describe the cheesecake:  It’s creamy and it isn’t dense. The cake isn’t as sweet as you’d expect and it has a bit of tartness to it. The graham cracker crust is nice and thick (but I wish it had been a bit sweeter)","2022-06-13 22:04:57.298033+00:00"
"Westville","False","True","5","I REALLY enjoyed the Baked Challah Bread French Toast. At first glance, this looks like a pretty standard french toast—and it basically is. There’s no fancy plating or unique stuffing, it’s just 4 triangle slices of french toast topped with strawberries. Everything’s just done right. The french toast on its own has a bit of sweetness so even without syrup, it doesn’t feel like you’re eating just bread. The inside of the french toast is very custard-y (this is probably hit or miss for most people, but I liked it). The strawberries on top are fresh too—I was ready to eat them without the french toast because they were so good on their own.

I also got a side of their home fries. It’s not worth it. The potato chunks aren’t crispy, the bigger chunks aren’t fully cooked, and it definitely needs some salt. ","2022-09-04 12:36:08.332327+00:00"
"Hawa Smoothies","False","True","2","They sell bubble tea, smoothies, and fresh juice here. I just wanted juice, so I got the most normal sounding combination they had: Carrot, Beet, Apple, Ginger. It was gross—they added so much ginger, the juice tasted “spicy”. I really thought they’d just grind a little ginger in. I had to avoid smelling it to drink more of it. If you ever come here, stick to the smoothies or bubble tea. Those seem to have good ratings on Google. ","2022-09-06 03:23:34.905129+00:00"
"Cafe Michelina","False","True","4","Strong 4…I got their Stuffed Chicken Parm with Vodka Sauce (it was one of their specials that day). The picture isn’t that good, but I really enjoyed the meal. I liked the vodka sauce here much more than the sauce at Otto Strada (this sauce had way less straight tomato taste), and it came with a large portion of pasta. The chicken parm part was basically two thin chicken cutlets with four cheeses in between (though I could only tell two). I thought the chicken had a slightly off taste to it, but when I reheated and ate the leftovers, I didn’t notice anything…maybe it was all in my head. Besides that, the chicken was good. I really wanted to try their Tiramisu, but I was pretty full.","2022-08-12 17:56:28.757841+00:00"
"Pariwaar Delights - A Taste Of Good Life","False","True","4","There are a lot of Indian restaurants really close to where I live, and based on the ones I’ve been to and Google reviews, they’re pretty mid. This place probably is too, but after my conversation with @srikanth about Chicken 65, I figured I’d risk it and pickup some Chicken 65. As you can see, it definitely doesn’t look impressive, but honestly it’s not bad. That classic Chicken 65 flavor is def","2022-06-23 18:32:37.855492+00:00"
"Green Eggs Cafe","False","True","4","I’d say this place is the go-to breakfast/brunch location in Philadelphia. If you’ve ever doubted the claim that breakfast was an excuse to eat dessert in the morning, order something sweet and you’ll need no further convincing. Make no mistake, I mean this in a positive way because the Apple Pie French Toast certainly hit the spot. The portion size is also fantastic (which seems to be rare nowadays) almost to the point where I’d suggest reducing the sizes. I also got the hash browns which at Green Eggs Cafe are basically cheesy potato patties.  They’re good but they were basically a necessity to balance the intensely sweet French toast. They do offer savory entrees here, but I didn’t order any. Helpful tip: this place accepts cash only.","2022-05-06 21:18:17.198823+00:00"
"Il Nutino","False","True","4","I wanted to try Ravioli here but since it was listed under “First Courses” I was concerned it might be a small dish; the portion sizes in Italy are already relatively small. Eventually I decided to get a pizza, the Bianca Salsiccia Gorgonzola e porcini, to be specific. It’s a pizza with extra cheese, sausage, and mushrooms and it was solid. It tasted good and the flavors weren’t mellow or subtle or watered down. After a while, though, I did get sick of the Gorgonzola cheese, but I just picked it off of the pizza. The only complaint I had is that the pizza was really wet—covered in a layer of what I assume was water from the mushrooms. Thankfully, it didn’t affect the flavor of the pizza. ","2022-06-10 12:33:32.834127+00:00"
"Sweet Chick","False","True","5","The Buffalo chicken sandwich was SO good. It’s smaller than you might expect (the pictures on the menu make it seem bigger) and at first glance it’s  pretty unassuming, but the chicken isn’t overcooked and dry and the buffalo sauce it’s covered in is really flavorful. What really seals the deal is the blue cheese sauce they put on top. Unsurprisingly, it goes so well with the chicken.

I tried the Blueberry Muffin Waffle (this place is known for its chicken and waffles) but wasn’t really a fan. The waffles here are spongy not crispy and kind of heavy. The overall consensus of my group was that the chicken (whatever flavor you get) is really good but the waffles aren’t worth.","2022-09-05 15:51:26.652274+00:00"
"Ravagh Persian Grill","False","True","3","The food here is probably worth 4 stars but the price is why I’m dropping it to 3 stars. I ordered the Lamb Shank and split it with a friend. Its a huge piece of lamb (as you can see in the picture) and it comes with a bowl of dill rice. It also costs $30…

The meat is really tender and the flavor is good too. Don’t expect spice because it’s not spicy at all. Also the lamb meat flavor isn’t subtle—you can definitely tell that it’s lamb. Just to clarify, I did enjoy this—it’s the price that will keep me from coming back. ","2022-07-15 17:30:15.931390+00:00"
"Hummus Place","False","True","3","It’s hard to say whether this place deserves a 3 or 4 star rating. I think I would be more inclined to give it 4 stars if I hadn’t had the butternut squash soup. It really comes down to personal preference, but I didn’t enjoy the soup. Basically it has the consistency of a daal dish with the sweetness of butternut squash—a weird combination in my opinion. 

The falafel sandwich wasn’t bad. The pita bread itself was nice and soft, and the falafels themselves were ok. The main issue I had was the toppings. Of all the Mediterranean toppings out there, all this had was tomatoes, cucumbers, and I think tzatziki sauce. There was hummus on it too, but only a little bit and all of it was at the bottom. I think it’s fair to expect that a place called Hummus Place would have a bit more hummus on their dishes, and if it did I would’ve enjoyed the falafel sandwich a lot more. 

On a brighter note, the fries were nice and crispy. Ironically, the fries might’ve been the most solid part of this whole dish. ","2022-06-16 13:27:30.104744+00:00"
"Molly's Cupcakes","False","True","4","I got the blueberry cheesecake cupcake. They have a good amount of flavors here including normal ones like vanilla, chocolate, red velvet, etc. my cupcake was good…no complaints. The blueberries on top go really well with the sweet cupcake. Next time I come I’ll get the peach cobbler. Apparently it won cupcake wars on food network, and lives up to the hype.","2022-08-09 15:11:22.805474+00:00"
"Bagel Pantry","False","True","4","If I wasn’t blinded by my nostalgia for Bodos at Charlottesville, I’d probably give this place 5 stars. I haven’t had some good NY style bagels since college so it was nice to finally get bagels like this. The ones here were big and chewy but still had that  browned crust. The bagel was also seasoned well. I got a bacon, egg, and cheese on an everything bagel. It was great and they put a lot of bacon which I appreciate. ","2022-05-30 16:08:17.477562+00:00"
"Pizza Twist","False","True","3","Average pizza and average wings at a pretty average pizza joint. This place offers Indian chicken/paneer topping options, but we just got a cheese pizza and a veggie pizza. I gotta point out that the cheese pizza was very floppy. I did get an Indian flavor (Achari) sauce for the wings. The Google reviews hyped it up, but it’s ok. I should’ve just chosen bbq sauce or skipped the wings entirely.","2022-08-22 23:14:09.144967+00:00"
"Ristorante Terme di Diocleziano","False","True","3","So I got the Tonnarelli Agli Scampi which I assumed was the authentic Roman version of Shrimp Scampi, and honestly if this is the authentic version, then I’ll take the Italian American version any day. This pasta dish had no shrimp in it, just two cooked prawns (or maybe crawfish) on the side, head on and shell on. The sauce was good sure, but having no shrimp mixed in it was disappointing.  If the sauce wasn’t good, I would easily give this place 2 stars. I will say though that the pasta was cooked a perfect al dente. To all the people cooking pasta at home (like myself), I don’t think you can experience a true al dente texture without having pasta in Italy. It was just that surprising to me.","2022-06-07 22:07:25.084550+00:00"

"Eileen's Special Cheesecake","False","True","3","To be fair this place could go for either 3 or 4 stars, but I’m going with 3 since it was such a letdown compared to Mah Ze Dar. I really thought it could compete with them, but it definitely can’t. The cheesecake here aren’t sold as slices, they’re more like cupcake sized pieces. The cake itself has a bit of that tartness that makes it “New York style” cheesecake, but it’s not sweet enough. The graham cracker crust is pretty thin and crumbly and doesn’t really hold together. I had the plain cheesecake, but if for some reason I come back, I’ll try the marbled cheesecake instead","2022-06-21 00:37:25.243016+00:00"
"Szechaun Mirchi","False","True","3","I’m not a huge fan of Indian Fusion food. I find that they take a perfectly good Indian dish and hold back on the spice and make it sweet and/or tangy instead. This place was no exception. I got the chili chicken and although there was a bit of heat, the gravy had that tangy/sour flavor you’d associate with Indo-Chinese food. Overall, it’s basically what I was expecting, so I would have given it 4 stars if the chicken wasn’t over cooked. I think I’d come back eventually and try something else, but only because it’s so close to where I live ","2022-06-12 19:56:16.648478+00:00"
"Amiya","False","True","5","We started off with drinks here. This place has an extensive list of cocktails and the one I got, the Hurricane, was sweet and strong…just how I like it. I got the Kurkura Msaledar Murg appetizer (breaded and fried chicken wings with mint chutney on the side. I enjoyed it even though the waiter warned us that it would be salty. It was on the saltier side, but it wasn’t inedible salty. The chicken was very tender too. I got the Makhni Murgh (butter chicken), and I really liked it. We asked them to make it spicy, and they actually delivered. I’m so used to butter chicken being over cooked chicken thrown in overly sweet sauce, but the dish here actually had spice and didn’t taste like candy. As an added bonus, the chicken pieces weren’t over cooked and dry. I also liked the naan here. Most places’ naan is thin and tough and too crispy, but here the naan is thicker and bread-ier. Service here is good too—the waiter was really nice and he gave us drink recs and replaced a drink we didn’t like (and he gave us that heads up that the wings would be salty).

"Tonchin","False","True","4","I got the Tonchin Classic Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen, and it was great. The broth was very flavorful and definitely had a strong pork flavor. I think the portion size is perfect. It might be a bit less than other ramen places, but I think some other ramen places just add a ton of broth just for the sake of increasing the portion size.

I really appreciate the choice of toppings for this ramen. There aren’t too many toppings which is nice because my favorite parts of Tonkotsu ramen are the broth, noodles, chashu, and the egg. That being said, the egg was good but small and the noodles were fine but I’ve definitely had better. The main reason I’m hesitant to give this place 5 stars is the chashu pork. Instead of thick slices of meat, they give thin, deli-meat style slices. It’s definitely a downgrade and not as satisfying.

I know I’ll be back eventually. Maybe next time I’ll try the Smoked Dashi Ramen or the Miso Ginger Ramen, and I might order an extra egg. ","2022-06-22 14:48:08.111249+00:00"
"Peri Peri Original","False","True","5","I usually get the Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich here (which is fantastic), but today I decided to try out the Honey Garlic Chicken sandwich. I figured it would taste like the soy garlic flavor you might find at Korean chicken joints like Bonchon, but it was totally different. When I first started eating it, the  garlic flavor was very strong and it contrasts heavily with sweet honey. It’s a pretty unique flavor, but if you leave it for a little while the spices, garlic, and honey combine to taste almost like a barbecue sauce. I also got my sandwich hot (the spice level) and the trigger happy dude making my sandwich cranked the spice up to overdrive. It was killer, but I dig it. Overall, I still really enjoyed this sandwich but it’s a funky flavor so if you’re not ready to experiment, you’re better off sticking with the Nashville Hot. Also, get the potato wedges as your side. They’re slept on here. If you’re choosing the fries over the wedges, you’re doing a disservice to yourself and the potatoes from whence they came.","2022-05-16 21:25:42.769314+00:00"
"Luke's Lobster","False","True","4","My first time having a lobster roll…I got the 4oz (smaller size). It’s smaller than you expect and it’s pretty expensive, but I enjoyed it. There’s a good amount of meat considering it’s small size, and the meat itself is fresh and of good quality. They go easy on seasoning/mayo so that it doesn’t overpower the seafood, but I’d really prefer it with extra seasoning/mayo otherwise it feels like it’s missing something. The bread is buttered and toasted, and the lobster roll comes with a bag of chips. I’m glad I went and tried it, but I think I like crab more, so I probably won’t come back unless it’s to try their crab roll.","2022-08-08 12:03:11.330104+00:00"
"Bobwhite Counter","False","True","4","I hate to say it, but this place isn’t as good as I remembered it to be. After the last time I went, I would’ve given this place 5 stars, but it just wasn’t the same this time. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich and it’s still a really good sandwich. They put buffalo AND ranch sauce on it…a killer combo. The chicken itself was a bit less seasoned and a bit less crispy than I remembered. The Mac and Cheese side dish is fantastic though. It’s worth 5 stars on its own. It’s baked but still has lots of gooey cheese underneath. I think it also has some unique flavor (in a good way) that I just don’t taste in other Mac and Cheeses","2022-06-21 13:11:56.860053+00:00"
"Szechaun Mirchi","False","True","4","If this place wasn’t so close to where I live, I wouldn’t have given it a second chance, but I’m glad I did because I actually enjoyed the Shrimp Szechuan Fried Rice. The fried rice had this chili oil flavor that you might taste in some other Chinese food. I wish it was stronger in flavor or spice, but at least I could taste it. What surprised me the most (pleasantly) was that the dish 1) wasn’t sweet and 2) wasn’t greasy. It probably could’ve used a touch more salt, but that’s personal preference. The pieces of shrimp were very small and they weren’t marinated in anything, but at least there were more than 3-4 pieces. Regardless, feel free to substitute the shrimp with any other protein—I’m sure it’ll come out the same. ","2022-06-30 18:54:03.897313+00:00"
"Eileen's Special Cheesecake","False","True","4","Man I feel bad now. I did eventually try the marbled cheesecake, and I really enjoyed it. I didn’t eat it right away, so by the time I did, it had defrosted a bit. The chocolate in the cheesecake really adds a lot of flavor to the cake, and the chocolate cookie crust is WAY better than the graham cracker crust on the plain cheesecake.

When I compare this to Mah Ze Dar’s cheesecake, it’s a bit more complicated. Because of the size/shape of Eileen’s cheesecakes, I think it makes more sense to compare them to cupcakes. As a cupcake, this one was fantastic—definitely 4 stars, potentially 5 stars. As a cheesecake though, it really doesn’t compete with a solid slice of cheesecake—like one from Mah Ze Dar. 

Either way, my bad Eileen","2022-06-24 22:21:12.581984+00:00"
"Guapo's","False","True","4","I got the Birria Tacos, Fried Plantains, and Tres Leches cake here, but unfortunately I filled myself up on the chips they give you to snack on. Regardless, I did enjoy my food. I had never had Birria tacos before, and the ones here are quite filling. The Birria sauce is tasty but it was more oily that I was expecting. For some reason I thought it would be more like a thin gravy. The fried plantains were nice and sweet, but they’re cut thinner than the ones you’d get at a Peruvian chicken place, so there’s more char and crispiness on it—a nice touch. I’m a huge fan of Tres Leches cake and it was good here, but it was heavily soaked in the milk mixture. I think that’s traditional, but the Tres Leches cakes I’ve had before are only moderately soaked. Overall, a solid Mexican place. I’d be down to come back again and try something else on the menu.

Also, I had 2 massive mojitos here. They did not disappoint.","2022-05-27 18:39:09.444712+00:00"
"Charrito's","False","True","3","I got the Chicken Burrito (carryout). It came with refried beans and some rice. None of it looked particularly appetizing, but the rice and beans weren’t bad when I ate them together. The burrito isn’t bad either but it’s pretty underwhelming. I think the worst part of this is the price. Two burritos and a Coca Cola was $43. The food here technically isn’t bad, and that’s the only reason I’m giving it 3 stars. There’s another Mexican place next door called East LA…just go there instead.","2022-08-19 14:35:15.849035+00:00"
"Masala Cafe","False","True","3","I was just disappointed with this place. It’s rated 4.6 stars on Google so I thought I had finally hit the jackpot. I got the Boneless Chicken Biryani and the Chicken 65 and neither of them were bad, but I just wasn’t feeling it. The biryani didn’t really taste like a biryani you’d order from a restaurant, and it was kind of one note. Also if you’re wondering where all the chicken is, it’s probably on the bottom. Speaking of chicken, the Chicken 65 was pretty dry on the outside. It certainly could’ve been better. If I go back, maybe I’ll try the Chicken Fry, and that will be everything that I wanted from the Chicken 65","2022-06-13 15:12:01.257780+00:00"
"Napoli's Brick Oven Pizza","False","True","4","We got the Classic Original pizza and Mozzarella Sticks. We ordered carryout and by the time we got back home, it had cooled down a bit. The pizza was alright (ours was a cheese pizza with onions and green peppers). The mozzarella sticks didn’t look great and the cheese wasn’t very melty, but they still tasted really good. The cheese pizza here ends up being a bit pricey since they basically charge you for each extra topping, but there are specialty pizzas. I saw pictures of their vodka sauce pizza on their website and it looked pretty good—maybe I’ll get that the next time I come here.","2022-07-20 23:23:41.221928+00:00"
"Not Your Average Joe's","False","True","4","Honestly a restaurant with the name “Not Your Average Joe’s” sounds like a place known for its brutal mediocrity, but my BBQ pulled pork sandwich actually wasn’t bad—I’ve definitely had worse. It’s certainly not real, smoky BBQ, but it wasn’t dry and onion strings as a topping is a nice touch. The shoestring fries it came with were way too salty, though. Our waiter was very nice and friendly. It’s a 4-star place for me, but I should mention that 1) the free bread you get is cold 2) my dad got the jambalaya and he found it underwhelming and 3) this place is overhyped by people who work in the Reston area","2022-05-15 23:54:45.067980+00:00"
"Szechaun Mirchi","False","True","3","I dined in this time and got the Veggie Szechuan Fried Rice. I was kinda disappointed—the chili oil flavor was barely there and it definitely needed some salt. I also tried the Red Curry. It’s definitely not Thai red curry, but the taste is interesting—and not in a bad way. It did have some interesting choices of veggies though (there was okra in there). If I didn’t like the red curry, I’d be giving this 2 stars. ","2022-09-05 16:00:51.663612+00:00"
"Tenth Street Pasta & Pizza","False","True","4","We got the Classic pizza—as opposed to Square, Margherita, White—half cheese and half with mushrooms, olives, and onions. It’s pretty good thin crust pizza and it’s definitely better than the last pizza place I went to in Hoboken. I’m giving it four stars, but I’d be willing to give it three because of the awful service. When I called and placed my order, they said they’d text me when my food was ready. They never texted me…eventually I called them (at this point it had been about an hour since I ordered) and they said that it was ready. Who knows how long it had been ready for, but thankfully it was still somewhat warm when I got it, and it looked good","2022-08-05 20:53:56.987432+00:00"
"V{IV}","False","True","5","I ran into @vamsi here while picking up lunch…what a crazy coincidence. They have a bunch of unique dishes here, but I still ended up ordering the Basil Fried Rice. It tasted great and it was very flavorful. I asked them to make it spicy and they certainly delivered on that request. From what I could see, the interior looked a bit upscale…I appreciate that the prices don’t reflect that. There’s not much to say—it’s just some really good Thai food. ","2022-07-14 20:00:29.688613+00:00"
"Es Nautic Restaurante","False","True","3","Man I was so excited to finally try Paella, like what could go wrong with a dish with rice and seafood. This place was even recommended to us specifically for the Paella. Unfortunately though my dreams were crushed, and I just really didn’t enjoy it that much. I got the Paella de pescado y marisco (Fish and Seafood Paella) and I really liked the rice. It was very flavorful, probably in part due to being cooked with the seafood. The problem I had was with the seafood. The dish had mussels, fish, shrimp, prawns, and a lot of something else (I think it was squid). The seafood was over cooked and turned rubbery and there was just so much of it especially the squid (which I don’t like). This might be the first time where I ordered a seafood dish at a restaurant and there was just TOO MUCH seafood. 

On a more positive note, they serve this garlic aioli mayonnaise with the free bread appetizer and it is so good. ","2022-06-07 15:48:42.216181+00:00"
