"Lil Frankie's","False","True","4","The ambiance: as East Village-y as it gets.

This place has been on my list for a long time and a Monday night was the perfect time to try it. Wood-fired pizza + pasta and a vast wine selection. Tasted only the pizza so I would come back for pasta. It was goat cheese, roasted eggplant, roasted red peppers topped with arugula. YUMMY. I’m a crust girl and it was fluffy, light - perfect. Def a great weeknight spot: cash only though! ","2022-05-24 14:07:05.093881+00:00"
"SONA","False","True","3","Food was very average. Chaat was basically tater tots with sauce and I would’ve been happier with regular tots and ketchup. The lamb was chewy and spicy with no flavor. Their favorite ingredient is tomato paste apparently because three dishes had the exact same flavor. Drinks were meh. Servers were very kind though! ","2022-05-22 16:00:34.524221+00:00"
"Two Boots","False","True","5","I’m a devotee of Joe’s on Carmine for a late-night slice, but Two Boots beats it! They have vegan + regular options, but I can’t tell difference. My fave slice: The Tony Clifton (caramelized onions & shiitake mushrooms topped with a sweet red pepper sauce and mozzarella.) there’s a vegan version that’s just as delish.
