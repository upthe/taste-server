"State Bird Provisions","False","True","3","1 Michelin star! Unreal.

State Bird Provisions tries this Asian fusion dim sum concept. Its like when Hollywood filmed the movie adaptation of Dragon Ball with all white actors. Vaguely Asian and so much worse than the source material. Although perhaps an unfair comparison as the Dragon Ball movie is criminally bad.

SBD’s take on dim sum just does not hit at all. We tried 8+ dishes and only one dish (the corn mochi) stood out. The other dishes, “new takes” on traditional dim sum, were misses or just fine. The Taiwanese sausage small plate in particular was so disappointing - literally not even as good as the processed sausages I can buy at the super market.

The flagship dish - the State Bird (fried quail) - was underwhelming. The breading was actually dank, but why quail! I found myself craving a fried chicken thigh instead.

For whatever reason, SBD is super popular. I hope my next friends who try it have a better experience.","2022-07-22 03:34:20.698797+00:00"
"Momofuku Ko","False","True","3","Unfortunately an underwhelming dining experience for a 2 star Michelin restaurant

Only a few highs and unfortunately more than a few lows in the tasting menu.","2022-05-06 01:45:08.337703+00:00"
"Sotto Mare","False","True","5","Excellent seafood. Crab cioppino was delicious, oysters were fresh, and seafood linguine was on point.

Reasonably good prices too esp for Bay Area","2022-05-12 02:17:25.381396+00:00"
"uluh","False","True","5","Continues to be the best Chinese food in the city","2022-05-07 19:58:41.476102+00:00"
"Farmhouse Kitchen","False","True","3","So underwhelming and over priced. I can’t believe this place is so popular on Yelp in SF.

Everything was fine, nothing slapped. And I had to $8 to add beef!","2022-07-21 22:34:52.264922+00:00"
"Emily - West Village","False","True","4","Pretty tasty Detroit style pizza (thicker crust). Unconventional toppings. They have a family menu option where you can get 3 pizzas and some sides for $80. Otherwise somewhat pricey for pizza ","2022-06-09 00:27:45.064755+00:00"
"Thai Villa","False","True","4","Food is good, but not insanely tasty. I’m surprised there are so many yelp reviews and how it’s hugely popular. Ambiance is really nice","2022-05-04 19:46:01.954344+00:00"
"Hometown Bar-B-Que","False","True","5","Extremely dank BBQ out in Red Hook. Best spare ribs I’ve ever had - extremely tender, flavorful, and fall off the bone. Brisket, Mac and cheese, and breaded cauliflower were excellent as well. Thick pastrami bacon was interesting, but a bit too fatty - probably would not get again.

Had to wait about an hour in line. Also, it’s on the pricier side - we spent $50 each in our group of 4. Worth coming out here for a feast though.","2022-07-14 14:27:52.821638+00:00"
"Lucali","False","True","5","Another Brooklyn heavyweight.

Best pizza crust I’ve ever had. First bite of pizza was really good. I wish the pizza was a little saucier, but otherwise it was nearly a perfect pizza slice. 

We also got the large calzone. Usually ricotta cheese is nothing to write home about, but the ricotta they used was exceptionally fresh. and flavorful. Calzone was excellent.

The menu is simple - you have two options (pizza or calzone) and can pick from a number of toppings to add.

Plan ahead to get a table. We got in line at 330 and put our names down at 420 for a 730PM reservation. Note the restaurant opens  at 5PM, and people start lining up at 3PM to get tables.

Overall - a little overhyped but fantastic, 5 star pizza. Mark Wahlberg was apparently there the same day as us.","2022-07-14 14:37:38.728381+00:00"
"Chow House","False","True","5","Very authentic Sichuan food. IMO better than Cafe China and Chili. It may be coming for the throne from Uluh.

Also no wait due to its location in West Village, which I guess is not an Asian food hot spot","2022-05-21 22:06:25.564536+00:00"
"Chicken Salad Chick","False","True","5","This place is a vibe","2022-05-15 03:43:09.296935+00:00"
"Vida Verde","False","True","4","Great place for drinks and tacos - good ambiance, music was bumping.

Tacos were mixed - fish taco was excellent, carnitas and chicken tacos were merely okay (partially bc I don’t like corn tortillas).

Sangria is not bad","2022-05-18 14:21:07.465372+00:00"
"Captain George's","False","True","5","One of the best restaurants in the United States, potentially the world.

Fresh, all you can eat snow crab and dungeness crab! It doesn’t get much better than that.

End your meal with their world famous Reese’s cake.","2022-07-22 03:46:26.158669+00:00"

"Barn Joo","False","True","3","Mediocre food, relatively overpriced compared to what you could get for better food in Ktown. Good ambiance though.","2022-05-01 05:44:11.203966+00:00"
"Emmett's","False","True","3","Emmett’s Pizza is a pizza spot in West Village.

We ordered three pizzas in theory, but got one pizza, one cheesy bread, and one garlic bread in practice. The thin crust “Hot Papi” is quite good and felt like a real pizza. The deep dish pizza was lowkey tasty but was more like cheese bread as it had way too much cheese. The last thin crust pizza had NO CHEESE somehow, only garlic, tomato sauce and basil leaves. Big brain move was to move extra cheese from the Deep dish to the no-cheese pizza.","2022-05-23 02:01:10.567939+00:00"
"Boqueria","False","True","4","This place could be the move if you like tapas.

We did the $65 prix fixe menu (vs the other $52 prix fixe). Note the only difference between the two is a plate of jamon iberico charcuterie, which IMO is not really worth the $13 price difference, so I would recommend the $52.

We got tons of food (like 8 dishes) so lowkey this place is worth it. Highlights were the papas bravas, some garlic shrimp thing (actually very flavorful), and the seafood PAELLA (excellent). Main lowlight was the steak, which was not tender enough and under seasoned. We struggled to finish the steak as a result.

As predicted, dessert was chocolate and churros. We also got two pitchers of sangria, which were good but somehow caused our bill to become $100+ a person (expensive!).

"uluh","False","True","5","6 stars if I could. Best Chinese food in the city. Make sure your order the right things.","2022-05-05 02:03:54.063650+00:00"
"Jiang Nan","False","True","5","Not quite a blue blood 5 star but definitely better than most 4 star places.

This place has exceptional vibes. Felt like I was in China. Had a koifish pond, fake trees, etc. Service is amazing. Bathroom line is way too long unfortunately, like 20 min wait time.

Everything we ordered was quite good. The beef brisket and potatoes was so close to being MEGA dank but unfortunately the brisket and tendon were too chewy :( my disappoint here is why they’re not a true 5 star.

We also got the spicy fish tray, which was quite tasty, but more of a novelty than a filling dish. Flavor and sides were very good, but the striped bass was just not meaty enough.

Get the tea if you go. Best tea I’ve ever had.
