"Lazy Bear","False","True","5","This was an expensive, 2 michellin star restaurant that is likely best reserved for special occasions. HOWEVER, as a self- described carnivore I have NEVER enjoyed vegetables so much. Definitely a top 5 meal in my LIFE. Excellent service too and extremely accommodating for allergies!","2022-06-12 15:26:17.531842+00:00"
