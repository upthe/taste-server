"Yindee Thai Restaurant","False","True","3","Pad Thai is solid. Lunch menu options are cheap but regular menu is expensive. Full bar but drinks are hella $$$, better off sneaking alcohol bags in through socks/pockets","2022-06-04 20:16:10.360035+00:00"
"JINYA Ramen Bar","False","True","5","Both vegetarian/vegan ramen dishes here are fantastic. Recommend asking for a red hot sauce on the side for added üî•üî•","2022-07-13 00:52:55.973537+00:00"
"Mia's Italian Kitchen","False","True","4","Great outdoor dining spot near the river. Inside decor looks nice. Classic Italian food with lots of variety on pastas/pizza. 

4 stars because $$$ and different rules on cheaper bar food depending on where you are seated which was weird","2022-06-10 01:44:19.602702+00:00"
"Taco Bell","False","True","4","Great food, Mexican Pizza overpriced but nostalgic. ","2022-05-27 02:48:34.987432+00:00"
"Panisa Thai Dining","False","True","4","Small family owned restaurant. Great food, curries and fried rice are standouts. Quality of food post-pandemic slightly lower after some chefs were let go. Prices also slightly higher (in line with other Thai places in NOVA)","2022-05-21 13:25:08.933248+00:00"
"Taco Bell","False","True","1","A ‚Äúfriend‚Äù asked me to drive 10 miles out of my way to come to this establishment. Vegetarians beware! They put meat on my veggie order and this isn‚Äôt the first time thats happened at this location apparently","2022-06-04 20:19:06.257522+00:00"
"Raaga Tandoor","False","True","3","This is a classic White People‚Äôs Indian Restaurant‚Ñ¢

Staples such as Butter Chicken/Paneer are solid but more authentic dishes are not great. 

Bumping to a 3 because the Mixed Vegetable Korma is a fantastic dish and I will go out of my way to order this if I‚Äôm eating North Indian food.

TLDR; Mediocre food and better options within 20 minutes driving","2022-07-17 19:49:03.145887+00:00"
"Taco Bell","False","True","5","6 words: Mountain Dew Baja Blast Freeze w/ Alcohol!

(Get the Rum added with any drink and thank me later)","2022-06-10 01:40:04.861793+00:00"
"Peterson's Ice Cream Depot","False","True","5","Rated best ice cream in NOVA years ago and it still holds up now. I‚Äôm partial to the sorbet (Lemon/Mangoüò≥) but the regular ice cream slaps too. 

Small family-owned place, def on the bucket list to grab dessert if you‚Äôre in south NOVA","2022-06-21 14:38:19.505097+00:00"
"Madigan's Waterfront","False","True","4","Happy hour right on the river. Nice ambience and wait staff was great. Better selection of drinks/more vegetarian options would have been nice.","2022-06-17 20:56:54.895460+00:00"
"Clifton Cafe","False","True","5","Great selection of sweet + savory crepes. Ani‚Äôs bananaberry (nutella, banana, berries, powdered sugar) is üî•üî•
","2022-06-24 21:28:49.918390+00:00"
"Bansari Indian Cuisine","False","True","2","Chilli Paneer was way too runny, Paneer Tikka Masala very bland. Different types of naan‚Äôs were interesting but none stuck out. Would not go back","2022-08-29 01:23:57.007512+00:00"
"Chuy's","False","True","5","Top-Tier Mexican food chain in NOVA - Vegetarian friendly although certain Veg items were taken off the menu post-pandemic. 

Definitely ask for a variety of sauces with the chips (Jalapeno sauce hits differentüò§)

Also, the Tres Leches cake for dessert is one of the best I‚Äôve had.","2022-07-17 19:35:02.101127+00:00"
"Trattoria Villagio","False","True","5","Fantastic Italian food. Sit outdoors near the fountain if you can. Lots of good drink options (Seasonal Sangria if available is a must). Good vegetarian options as well","2022-06-21 14:30:05.615919+00:00"
"Trattoria Villagio","False","True","5","Went back here with friends who lived in Italy for years. They said this was as good as any Italian food (outside Italy) they‚Äôve had. Not much room for higher praise!","2022-07-11 22:39:28.480638+00:00"
"Out of the Bubble Bakery","False","True","5","Quaint little bakery. Great selection of different teas as well as cupcakes/pastries. Menu changes weekly fyi","2022-06-02 18:47:34.017038+00:00"
"Taco Bell","False","True","2","Vegetarians beware! Despite clearly asking for vegetarian substitutes, I‚Äôve gotten meat 3 out of 5 times here. I know its combo‚Äôd with a KFC but come on","2022-05-29 13:21:17.151275+00:00"
