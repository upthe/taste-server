"Ted's Bulletin","False","True","4","Dinner food is okay, decent vegetarian options. Their breakfast is much better. The ted’s tarts and breakfast combos are pretty good for a fair price","2022-04-21 14:46:10.556216+00:00"
"Inchin's Bamboo Garden","False","True","4","Paneer fried rice is pretty solid, the spice level can be a bit much at times but that’s the fun of it. Also Gobi Manchuria and the Hakka Noodles are pretty good as well. Prices are super reasonable! 

It’s a bit chaotic in there at times but overall the restaurant is decently maintained ","2022-06-04 03:51:01.197423+00:00"
"Philz Coffee","False","True","4","Coffee shop is great to work or chill in. The coffee flavors are interesting, but a bit overpriced. I average $5-6 for a medium depending on if it’s a specialty drink or another type. Great breakfast sandwiches, specifically the impossible plant based one.","2022-04-19 12:22:19.984019+00:00"
"Bartaco","False","True","3","Drinks are great here but the portions are very small and there aren’t many vegetarian options","2022-04-19 12:20:02.916713+00:00"
