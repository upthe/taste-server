"VeganBurg","False","True","4","The burgers here are really good! I‚Äôve gotten the Avocado Beetroot Burger and Creamy Shrooms Burger before and enjoyed both. The creamy vegan aioli they give with some burgers is great too. Only ever done takeout so don‚Äôt know about the ambience but looks cute from pictures.","2022-05-24 23:47:31.963188+00:00"
"54 Mint","False","True","3","I got the cacio e pepe as takeout. It was good but nothing extraordinary. I went after a few friend recs and Google reviews seemed great but not a lot of vegetarian options sadly. Might be better for non vegetarians? Idk ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ","2022-05-27 20:17:44.845464+00:00"
"Harp & Crown","False","True","4","The main level looks nice on entry but the rest of the level is kinda okay. Also there was this weird paint smell the first time I went which was off putting. Food and drinks were pretty good but nothing that special. I think the main thing that tips this place to a 4 is the hidden underground bowling alley and bar space. Would be great for a private party. Hope we‚Äôll actually be able to reserve the bowling alley someday!","2022-09-14 15:29:29.176486+00:00"
"Pietro's Pizzeria Birerria - Radnor","False","True","4","Solid Italian food. Came here for dinner and definitely felt like comfort food. Their Valentina artisanal pizza was nice, but really enjoyed the rigatoni alla vodka (made vegetarian) and the cheese ravioli cause just general more of a pasta person and they really listened when we said we like pasta with sauce on the heavier side. Ambience is also really cute with wine bottles on the shelf walls. There is not too much more to try in terms of vegetarian dishes so not sure if I would repeat, but a good one time try!","2022-07-26 21:16:07.865415+00:00"
"Hinodeya Ramen Bar","False","True","4","I got very mixed reviews about this place from other people but when I tried it thought the Creamy Veggie Ramen was pretty good! The broth was really flavorful and they did a good job with keeping all the elements fresh and separate since it was takeout. Happy I tried it üòä","2022-06-01 21:47:12.849379+00:00"
"Base Crave","False","True","3","We got takeout from here twice because our l friends love this place. Sohil also liked it, but I‚Äôm not a fan of paneer gravy that has hints of sweetness meh. Apparently that‚Äôs ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù but I‚Äôm against it. The Ginger Tamarind Soda was great though so would recommend that!!","2023-02-12 15:47:33.260479+00:00"
"Suraya","False","True","3","The food was all fairly good, and the cocktails were sublime. But I knocked this place down a star because there was only one vegetarian main dish, and no falafel on the menu either which is very interesting for a Mediterranean/Israeli restaurant. We had to spend quite a bit here as well. The ambience is really nice though. I could easily see this place being a 4/5 for non-vegetarians.","2022-07-14 13:17:17.539901+00:00"
"The Italian Homemade Company","False","True","2","Sooo disappointing. I was so excited to try this because my biggest pasta nerd of a friend recommended it but I got pasta with pesto sauce and it was insanely oily. Haven‚Äôt been able to bring myself to go back since. I think I might have just gotten the wrong dish because a lot of people have told me it‚Äôs great, especially for dessert. Maybe one day, but I am very hesitant about the pasta now üòì","2022-05-27 20:23:51.036293+00:00"
"R & D","False","True","4","This is a 4 for the cocktails, and because it‚Äôs one of Sohil‚Äôs favorite cocktail bars in Philly hahah. I personally feel like he overhyped the experience a bit but he said it was very different pre-Covid. The service is good though and it is always packed. I just don‚Äôt love the whole package enough to give it a 5 like I know he probably would.","2022-09-16 13:13:30.169139+00:00"
"Loco Pez","False","True","3","Good number of vegetarian options but food was okay overall, nothing that special. We did really enjoy the queso because it was like nacho cheese in India. Also liked that they had karaoke night going on when we went which made for a nice atmosphere üéâ","2023-05-10 17:42:30.908969+00:00"
"Jonquils Cafe & Bakery","False","True","5","Umm, just divine. Extraordinary looking and tasting desserts over here. Just had to be a bit ignorant that technically most of them have gelatin unfortunately üôà But otherwise very solid üíØ","2023-04-04 03:19:52.765852+00:00"
"Charlie Was a Sinner","False","True","4","Solid 4. The first time I went I put it at a 3.5 but the menu keeps changing and dinner last night was great! Plus we sat inside this time and the vibe was really nice compared to the first time when we sat outside because we are still amidst the first Covid wave in 2020. This place is 100% vegan which I love! Everything we got was pretty good - the potato croquettes, tamal, korean spiced crispy tofu, potato gnocchi, Charlie sliders. I think the Tamal was the best thing we got üôåüèΩ Also drinks here are very solid and actually what the place is known most for! This place also has a very interesting backstory behind the name which I recommend asking one of the waiters. A must try at least once! ","2022-07-24 14:17:25.573845+00:00"
"Spiceklub","False","True","4","Came for dinner and we really enjoyed it! Ordered wayy too much, but almost everything was good as a one time try and was worthy of being called molecular gastronomy. We mostly got starters because that‚Äôs what we were told were the best items on the menu. The Mushroom and Spinach Shashlik was the highlight in terms of starters. We also took a risk and got an entree but we‚Äôre so glad we did because the mushroom truffle biryani was amazing!! Also got dessert which was pretty fun to play with, but not sure I would get them again cause the taste itself was okay. ","2022-06-07 15:53:42.985046+00:00"
"Las Bugambilias","False","True","5","Came here for Sohil‚Äôs birthday and we honestly loved it! A lot of unique vegetarian options and pretty much everything we got tasted great, including the margarita pitcher! The ambience is also very nice. Highly recommend üòä","2023-05-10 17:39:56.003481+00:00"
"Tai Me Up","False","True","3","Food was decent, but pretty far from authentic Thai food. Needed some extra seasoning for sure. There were a good number of options for vegetarians and the ambience is really nice though. Could maybe be down to try again in case we just got the wrong items which unfortunately just did not hit the spot.","2022-07-20 02:43:55.351107+00:00"
"Renata's Kitchen","False","True","3","Overall, the food was very average for the most part and nothing was great about the service. Have definitely been to better Mediterranean in the Philly but it was fine as a one time go. I mainly wanted to go for the board/card games which were actually pretty fun. Only thing was the ambience was pretty dead inside so would have been nice if it was a bit livelier. ","2023-04-18 13:25:29.657402+00:00"
"Aman's Artisan Indian Cuisine","False","True","5","I‚Äôm obsessed with this place. We drove an hour and a half to Easton, PA just to eat here and I would do it again. Apparently we weren‚Äôt the only ones and some people had driven 2+ hours to do the same (or so the owner said hahah). The Paneer Tikka is amazing, and also really loved the Paneer Kalimirch - this is the first place I‚Äôve ever tried this dish and loved it. I know some people who have said they find it a bit sweet but I think that‚Äôs BS tbh and not just because I‚Äôm Gujju. Also the desserts üòçüòç We got the Gulab Jamun ice cream and it was so bomb. Ambience is also really nice. I only wish this place was closer!","2022-09-02 01:10:01.244285+00:00"
"Pyeong Chang Tofu House","False","True","4","Went here after a recommendation from someone Korean so I was expecting it to be good. I personally felt that it did not disappoint. The tofu soup was bubbling and very comforting. It was also nice to see two vegetarian options on the menu for tofu soup since that‚Äôs not common. I also liked the bibimbap, but not as much. The mung bean pancakes were great though. Mom did not love much except the pancakes, I think it might be because Korean food is a bit of an acquired taste. Service was pretty quick though and restaurant ambience was also nice especially because we snagged a place by the windows upfront.","2022-06-02 13:12:16.325379+00:00"
"BAIA","False","True","4","Came for brunch. The cacio e pepe egg scramble was pretty good, not super easy to tell it‚Äôs vegan even to an egg lover like myself and how they did that is incredible. I‚Äôm not huge on faux meat so didn‚Äôt love the meatball parmesan sandwich Sohil got but he loved it. Drinks were okay. Overall have been to better vegan places for sure, but they still did a good job. And we were able to get a spot without a reservation which is unheard of in SF üíØ ","2022-05-29 14:03:14.130643+00:00"
"Surisan","False","True","5","An amazing bottomless brunch spot! You get multiple flavors of mimosas and they‚Äôre all pretty good. Food is also really yummy, got the souffl√© egg skillet made vegetarian last time and that was great. They‚Äôre generally pretty flexible with tweaking dishes. Top it off with great views in the north beach/marina area make it well worth the visit.","2022-05-29 00:39:05.692785+00:00"
"Talula's Garden","False","True","3","Suuuper disappointing. Especially for how expensive and over-hyped this place is with 4.7 stars on Google reviews. The omelette was really under seasoned, the avocado toast was very okay, the only good thing we had was the bananas foster french toast sticks. But the portions were pretty small for most dishes and we paid a bomb. The ambience outside is also not great, would definitely not recommend going unless you get seating inside, and maybe for dinner/dessert instead if that‚Äôs better, especially if you‚Äôre vegetarian. ","2022-07-10 21:50:18.605152+00:00"
"Queen & Rook Game Cafe","False","True","4","Love this place! Never thought I would ever come across a 100% vegan board game cafe so this was magical. I would say the food itself is okay, except the Korean Style Fried Caulifower which is amazingg. Cocktails are also great. But the extra star is because there are a great selection of board games and super friendly game masters! Ambience is also really cozy. I know I‚Äôll keep coming back here cause it‚Äôs always a good time üòä","2022-07-12 02:10:40.801789+00:00"
"Rec & Royal","False","True","2","Was so excited about this place because of the online promise of a game room, karaoke and a fun ambience but was very disappointed. Although it seemed like the individual elements were there, this place had a very young crowd the night we came in, definitely seemed like more of a college kids scene. But then again so is Monroe‚Äôs in SF although Monroe‚Äôs is definitely classier. I think this place needs a pretty big group of people to be fun so you won‚Äôt notice the other people lol. Didn‚Äôt get a chance to try the drinks or actually do anything though because we were in and out pretty fast.","2022-09-08 11:51:54.470892+00:00"
"Mensho Tokyo SF","False","True","3","The Vegan Tantanmen Ramen itself was good, but the wait was WAY too long and the service/ambience were both nothing special. I‚Äôve had better veggie ramen and would not wait in line again (2 hours‚Ä¶) Without the wait and the hype around this place would have probably given it a 4.","2022-06-03 13:33:33.043259+00:00"
"Pink Onion","False","True","5","One of my FAVOURITE Italian places in SF, especially for pizza. Have been here multiple times and it‚Äôs a staple. The place itself is really small but I can‚Äôt deny how heavenly the burrata place and the many vegetarian pizzas are. They even stay great after takeout. Really want to try the pastas next time but I always get sucked in by the pizza. A must go!","2022-05-27 23:32:57.270545+00:00"
"Ananda Fuara","False","True","2","The portions are too large, there was too much soy in the faux meat which actually gave me food poisoning (this is not common for me at all), and the vibe of the place is super cult-like. The only reason this is not a 1 star is because there are a lot of vegetarian options and I feel like I might have just gotten the wrong thing so giving the place the benefit of the doubt. Still, I have too much ptsd to ever try this place again :(","2022-05-29 23:55:57.549696+00:00"
"The Mediterranean Restaurant & Bakery","False","True","4","Was a beautiful summer night when we came for dinner so tables were outside and there was some acoustic live music which was a really enjoyable ambience. The Mediterranean food here was really good, especially the falafels, but the Italian food was a bit of a let down for how good it sounded. Dessert is also great, both the baklava and chocolate cake! It‚Äôs also byob üôåüèΩ Glad we tried this place at least the one time üòä","2022-07-19 12:41:12.576359+00:00"
"Bistro on Bridge","False","True","3","This review is purely from the standpoint of vegetarian food. Love the cauliflower wings, and they have a lot of great sauces to choose from. The roasted vegetable bistro bowl was good but I wish there was a lot more pesto than they put. The veggie burger was okay, have had better elsewhere. The ambience though was really nice, and I think would be even better earlier in the evening/on other nights when they have live music as well! Would be down to go again from a happy hour standpoint for those wings and for dessert! üòõ","2022-07-20 22:25:19.210757+00:00"
"Zahav","False","True","4","Sohil and a lot of other people will probably kill me for only giving this 4 stars but unfortunately I didn‚Äôt like all the mains. The laffa bread, hummus, salatim were definitely some of the best I‚Äôve ever had though. Although it‚Äôs quite a pricey set dinner, they do give you a lot which I guess makes it worth it, but I would have loved to be able to choose a la carte and eaten less because I was stuffed at the end. They also do really great desserts. All in all I think it was worth it, but not sure I would splurge here on dinner again (although I know many people would fight me on this üòÖüôà)","2022-07-16 21:00:56.928103+00:00"
"Death by Taco","False","True","4","I honestly love this place and have eaten many things from here multiple times. Dine in is way better than take out. One of the most expansive veggie taco menus I‚Äôve ever seen. The only thing that makes me sad is this place is so expensive. I‚Äôll still be back though ü§óü§ó","2022-05-25 20:31:43.735795+00:00"
"Himalayan Kitchen","False","True","5","Have only had the chilli momos but they were üî• Some of the best momos I‚Äôve ever had in the US!! They also looked like they had a lot of authentic nepali dishes so would definitely be down to try more items next time.","2023-04-02 14:44:58.993620+00:00"
"Bellota","False","True","2","The patatas bravas were disappointing, paella took forever to come and still didn‚Äôt taste great - pretty bland. Servers were okay. We also had
to sit outside in the freezing cold because it was Covid times which didn‚Äôt help, especially since the lamp heaters weren‚Äôt working very well. This is rated pretty highly on Google so not sure if I‚Äôm being too harsh but I‚Äôve had much better Spanish food before so have a high bar!","2022-05-26 05:45:37.329126+00:00"
"Manam Indian Cuisine","False","True","4","Good comfort Indian food. Have been here a couple of times, and this was actually the first place I ever tried kothu paratha - they do a good one here! Their North Indian sabjis and daals are also nice in general. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of their biryani though and the ambience is very okay. I think I would put this place closer to a 3.5 overall but since that‚Äôs not an option being generous with a 4.","2022-07-27 12:12:54.738327+00:00"
"Vedge Restaurant","False","True","5","An extremely fancy fully vegan restaurant that‚Äôs known as one of the best restaurants in Philly! Fell in love with this place the first time I went, especially because of their Spicy Dan Dan Noodles, this French Onion Soup spiced with Pho Broth and last but definitely not least, the divine Halva Cheesecake we had for dessert. I thought the other dishes we had were okay tasting, but definitely still high points for creativity, Cocktails are also nice, but probably better at other places since Vedge is super expensive. I don‚Äôt know how many times my pocket can afford this place, but the desserts are the highlight (no idea how they do these vegan) but I can definitely see myself coming back just for those post dinner. ","2022-07-15 19:12:06.791967+00:00"
"Taco & Ramen","False","True","5","My personal rating for just the food would be a high 4, low 5 but giving this place a 5 because they do such a good job with vegan/vegetarian options, the ambience is cute and service is quick. We enjoyed everything we got - the Tofu & Eggplant Tacos, the Fried Zucchini and Mushroom Tacos as well as the Vegan Spicy Kimchi Ramen. My only disappointments really were that the vegan noodles were like spaghetti noodles and I should have asked for the regular egg noodles instead since we‚Äôre not vegan and it makes a difference, the other was the fake meat which is not really my taste, I would have preferred Inari Tofu and the traditional soft boiled egg additions instead. Overall still great and I would come back as well as recommend to others! ","2022-10-05 12:56:27.917149+00:00"
"El Vez","False","True","4","Love that this place had 5 different flavors of guacamole, haven‚Äôt seen that at a lot of places. We got the Tito Santana with Mango, Bell Peppers, Habanero and Chiles which was good. I also really liked the Queso Fundido de Hongos, but honestly there was no way I wasn‚Äôt going to like something with that much cheese üôà The Black Bean Enchiladas were good too. Overall I think we tried most of the vegetarian stuff on the menu except the other flavors of guacamole and the tacos so not sure how worth it is coming again, but maybe let‚Äôs see.","2022-07-15 12:37:28.684907+00:00"
"Lady M Cake Boutique","False","True","4","Great crepe cakes!! Liked some flavors more than others (we all had different preferences) but all round very solid for anyone who already likes crepe cakes.","2023-04-04 03:22:21.705398+00:00"
"Caf√© La Maude","False","True","5","Our go to brunch spot whenever people are visiting. There is ALWAYS a wait and you can‚Äôt make reservations so go early. It also byob so prep for that ahead of time and save $$. I love the green shakshuka and usually get that, but other menu items are good too, including the sweet stuff. The passionfruit sauce they serve is next level. If you have never had or love a Mediterranean brunch, this place is a must try.","2022-07-13 00:38:53.863154+00:00"
"Sofra Bakery & Cafe","False","True","5","Obsessed. This bakery has such a unique pastry and small bites menu. Their dips are also legendary. It‚Äôs a little bit pricey but I honestly don‚Äôt care, it‚Äôs worth it. Would come back anytime and would highly recommend!","2022-10-17 03:44:29.540574+00:00"
"Via Locusta","False","True","4","Nice fine dining Italian place. The stars of the show are the focaccia bread with honey butter and the doppio ravioli. Everything is else was good but not amazing, wish there was more pasta sauce. All the pasta was very fresh though and the servers were really nice. I also loved my cocktail (Esterina Bay). The ambience is not as nice as it looks in the pictures in my opinion. It was a good one time visit but I‚Äôm not sure I would go back since it was decently expensive too.","2022-10-02 15:59:40.235780+00:00"
"Middle Child","False","True","4","Got the Bye Felicia Sandwich as takeout for lunch at work. I remember it being good but nothing that blew my mind. I would still consider going back again since Sohil hasn‚Äôt been and there are a lot of veg options!","2023-04-15 14:10:53.907173+00:00"
"Che Fico","False","True","2","The food was very okay, not enough sauce on the pasta despite requesting. Servers were also not very attentive. Drinks were terrible. Very thankful this was a free vendor meal üòÖ","2022-05-24 23:18:02.192752+00:00"
"Tomo Sushi & Ramen","False","True","4","This is the Shizen of Philly!! There are 10+ vegan sushi options and they‚Äôre all pretty good! Their ramen is good too. I do think it‚Äôs a bit hit or miss because the first time I went I really loved it, but the second time I thought the rolls were okay. I think it really depends on which rolls you get. The place is small, but still a pretty cute ambience. Currently my go to place for vegan sushi until I discover something better here üòä","2022-07-13 20:12:48.863705+00:00"
"Enjoy Vegetarian Restaurant","False","True","3","Got an eggplant tofu dish from here for takeout which was okay, nothing great.

"1 Tippling Place","False","True","4","The drink menu itself was not super expansive, but they‚Äôve very flexible and will make you something according to your taste profile which is cool. I also really liked the mid century parlour ambience of the place which definitely helped tip it over to a 4. Drinks are also fairly reasonably priced. Worth checking out once for sure.","2022-09-18 13:00:04.930004+00:00"
"Monster Vegan","False","True","3","Honestly very disappointing for the amazing 4.7 star reviews. We trusted Google reviews and came here for new years but actually really didn‚Äôt like quite a number of dishes because they were very heavy on soy protein, especially the sandwiches. The pasta was okay and the fries were good. The food also took forever to come. Overall ambience was also okay, quite small and not as nice as it looks in pictures. Would not come back here again and sad we ruined our New Year‚Äôs Eve appetite over this :(","2023-04-20 17:31:56.372195+00:00"
"Bar Bomb√≥n","False","True","4","Great Vegan Mexican place right next to Rittenhouse Square. All the food tasted really good, and the sauces they give with really enhanced the flavor too. Highlight for me was the Buffalo Cauliflower Tacos, they probably have the best one of these I‚Äôve ever tried. Place is also really cute, and was so packed for a vegan place on a weekday night. There were a lot of drink options but I didn‚Äôt love what we got, that‚Äôs probably the only knockdown of this place for me. ","2022-07-07 13:04:19.969694+00:00"
"UlavacharU Indian Restaurant","False","True","3","Had heard a lot about the biryani but personally thought it was okay. The salan was too spicy. Gobi Manchurian and Malai Kofta were solid but standard, could get the same quality in most places.","2022-06-05 22:50:33.169466+00:00"
"Khasiyat Fast Food","False","True","5","Find me another place in the US where you can get 100+ different types of parathas ü§§üíØ All the ones we got were amazing, most with 6+ fillings each everything from your classic paneer and aloo to things like basil, bean sprouts etc‚Ä¶ all of which actually tasted surprisingly great.

"Chashu Ramen + Izakaya","False","True","4","Such good ramen after really long! I would definitely recommend this place. Great ambience, good selection of yummy vegetarian options for a ramen place. Service was also quick and the servers are friendly. Also it was so reasonable! ~$15 per ramen bowl and they were huge. The only reasons it‚Äôs not a 5 is because it was missing the classic inari tofu and soft boiled egg that I love in my ramen, I‚Äôm not sure I would crave this place. But it was great for a one time visit.","2022-10-14 02:18:40.349293+00:00"
"Barcelona Wine Bar","False","True","5","This is our go to Spanish place in the city!! Have brought a lot of Philly first timers here and they always love it.

"The Continental Mid-Town","False","True","4","The drinks themselves were okay, not very memorable. But the ambience was really beautiful, both inside and on the patio. The food also looks like it would be good but we didn‚Äôt get around to trying anything. This is a bit of a benefit of the doubt rating since I‚Äôve heard good things about this place. Definitely has potential and I would try again to get a more accurate rating in.","2022-09-15 14:34:51.478167+00:00"
"Flight Club","False","True","5","Extra points for uniqueness. We loved this place with its fun darts games for groups. Don‚Äôt remember much about the drinks themselves so they were probably just okay (not bad or great), but would still definitely come back again because we laughed so much playing all the games here!","2023-04-09 23:37:55.327357+00:00"
"Bistro Romano","False","True","5","One of my favourite italian places in the city!! While I might rate the food itself at a high 4 (it is really very good but I have a high bar for Italian), this becomes a 5 because it has a separate vegetarian and vegan menu which is just üôåüèΩüôåüèΩ  and because it is one of the most elegant restaurant ambience‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever been to. I don‚Äôt want to ruin it by spoiling too much but make sure you go on the weekend! That‚Äôs when they have the live piano bar playing some of your favorite tunes from the 2000s making this place such a fun vibe.","2022-07-12 13:35:54.312561+00:00"
"Landwer Cafe","False","True","4","I honestly loved this brunch place!! Cute ambience, amazing and unique dishes (especially the shakshukas) and a great list of brunch beverages.

"Nopa","False","True","4","The rating is specifically for dinner which I thought was a lot better than brunch. Brunch would have been 3 stars for me because the vegetarian menu was pretty basic. Dinner menu was very innovative and everything tasted good. Best dish was the mushroom lasagna, wood baked butter beans were also pretty good. Drinks were not great unfortunately but ambience is nice.","2022-05-31 14:00:02.947983+00:00"
"Ramen Nagi","False","True","4","This place was so hyped up before we went which contributed to the 4 instead of 5 rating. The veggie king ramen itself was really good, but just disappointing that they only have one veggie ramen on the menu. The wait was also really long. Only went once and would probably go back but I hope they get to adding more veggie options on the menu!","2022-05-31 17:15:20.106827+00:00"
"Boqueria Penn Quarter","False","True","4","Food and environment were both good, there were sufficient vegetarian options and they also have bottomless mimosas for brunch. My main knockdown for this place is there is no vegetarian paella, but other than that this place was pretty solid.","2022-07-01 20:01:54.146154+00:00"
"Acquolina","False","True","4","I got some kind of a baked dish which was great and the wine was also really nice. Another bonus is the ambience is so cute both outside and inside so very nice for a date. It seems like the menu has changed now and there are a lot fewer vegetarian items than there used to be but not sure if they just had a separate veg menu in person. Worth checking out at least once!","2022-05-27 20:35:44.308649+00:00"
"White Jasmin Thai Cuisine","False","True","4","Really yummy Thai food, hugee portion sizes, and really friendly staff. Only reasons I knocked off a star is because the ambience itself is very basic and there are only 5 vegetarian options on the menu üòì Definitely try the tom kha soup which comes with udon noodles, it‚Äôs heavenly!!","2022-07-29 14:33:38.419260+00:00"
"Kokkari Estiatorio","False","True","3","The food was good, but didn‚Äôt live up to the hype. The portions were too small and dishes were pretty expensive. The ambience is amazing though. We enjoyed dessert the most! ","2022-05-24 23:08:35.829622+00:00"
"Limoncello - West Chester","False","True","5","I like this location (West Chester) more than the Chester Springs location food and ambience wise. The flatbreads, pastas (especially the penne alla vodka) and the desserts are all amazing. There are also a good number of vegetarian options. Would happily come back üòä","2022-08-31 14:33:57.033658+00:00"
"Wildseed","False","True","4","The food was good, and very unique, just some of the items missed the mark for me in terms of flavor and being able to tell it was vegan. Really wanted to try the spicy yellow curry but they had run out :( Best dish we had was the spicy sausage pizza, curried cauliflower is very basic so would not recommend. Overall place is very expensive for the portions so it‚Äôs hard to try again but maybe one more time for that curry üòõ ","2022-05-30 14:48:00.409044+00:00"
"Papalote","False","True","4","So many vegetarian options here!! Want to caveat that I called for takeout after a house party but really enjoyed my burrito. There‚Äôs a lot going on but it tasted great and because of all the veggies somehow felt healthy too. Their salsas that came with were also good and overall thought this was a pretty great decision despite never having heard a recommendation for this place.","2022-05-26 05:51:18.859271+00:00"
"Night Shift Brewing","False","True","3","Ambience was nice, especially location wise since it was right on the water.

"Starbelly","False","True","3","The food was good but pretty basic, nothing to write home about. It was also too expensive for what it was but I guess you‚Äôre paying for the ambience which was really nice especially on the patio where we sat. I believe the non vegetarian food is better because my friend enjoyed his meal. Huge portions so works as two dinners. Some the aioli‚Äôs that they gave with my fries stole the show üíØ","2022-05-30 14:40:55.049734+00:00"
"Philly Bagels","False","True","5","Saw a few people post reviews for bagel places so thought I would do my own haha. Not sure why Google Reviews for this place are so crap but I really enjoyed my Veggie Sammie bagel! With 20+ yummy looking cream cheese options and SUPER generous spreading of cream cheese (very appreciated) I would give this a 5. It‚Äôs not a sit down place but great for a reasonably priced to go option. I would come back again if I didn‚Äôt have much time for a proper sit down breakfast/lunch!","2022-08-01 20:33:35.031203+00:00"
"Collegeville Italian Bakery Pizzeria Napoletana","False","True","4","Have been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. They have 50+ different pizza varieties with so many vegetarian options it‚Äôs amazing. That and their NUTELLA BAR are the main reasons you come here although there are a couple of other items of the menu too. Honestly the first time I came here I didn‚Äôt love the pizza we got, but the second time we got individual slices and both were great! Also the Nutella soft serve and Nutella churros were both A+. The ambience is more of a diner feel but I like it, and it‚Äôs also cool that you get to see the pizzas being made live in their wood-fired brick oven üíØ","2022-07-28 12:39:26.768425+00:00"
"Veggie Crust","False","True","4","Always love a good Indian-flavored pizza ü•∞ We got the Paneer Manchurian pizza which was good but not amazing (more sauce would have been better for the flavor). But I would definitely come back since there are a lot of other flavors which look really good that you don‚Äôt get at most places like pav bhaji pizza, curry leaf pesto portabella pizza etc‚Ä¶ and even the non Indian veg flavors look really unique.","2022-10-19 12:50:20.768802+00:00"
"IndeBlue","False","True","4","Went for dinner. Pretty good modern Indian food, although it‚Äôs suuper pricey. Highlight was the crispy spinach chaat so definitely recommend that.

"Dumpling Time","False","True","3","This place has a lot of hype around it. I personally thought it was meh for vegetarians. Dumplings are okay, not super flavorful. Noodles were good but nothing great. Garlicky Green Beans were probably the best thing on the menu. Crispy sesame tofu squares were okay, not as good as they sound. Might have just  been the time I went because I know some people who swear by this place.","2022-06-03 15:17:34.098718+00:00"
"Spice Symphony","False","True","4","We only really got Indo-Chinese and everything was pretty good from the Manchow soup and Chinese bhel for starters to the Paneer Chili and Hakka Noodles for the mains. A lot of options on the menu to try, but not as many for Jains. Don‚Äôt know how the North Indian food is though! Review is purely for the Indo-Chinese.","2022-07-02 15:46:31.308670+00:00"
"Murph's Bar","False","True","5","Honestly love this place. Felt like really authentic but still creative Italian food. There were a lot of options for vegetarians and I would definitely go back. Maybe my only compliant is that there‚Äôs not enough seating space because it‚Äôs literally an Irish bar, and so they seat their last table super early. But otherwise great!","2023-05-10 17:45:14.576673+00:00"
"Ristorante Pesto","False","True","4","Went for dinner, and everything we got tasted good from the Eggplant Rollatini and Portobello Parmagiana starters to the Pasta Primavera in rose sauce and Gnocchi in Pesto Sauce. Tiramisu for dessert was also nice and good portion sizes for everything. We managed to fill ourselves up by paying only $20 each so that was a win üôåüèΩ Also it‚Äôs byob so you don‚Äôt have to pay a bomb for drinks! Brought our wine with us. Only dropped a star because there weren‚Äôt as many vegetarian options as I would like, but otherwise this place is pretty awesome üëåüèΩ","2022-07-17 19:49:19.114385+00:00"
"Spice Finch","False","True","5","This place is such a great find, one of the best fine dining Mediterranean places I‚Äôve ever been to. Obsessed with everything we got which included the Green Hummus, Broccoli Tabbouleh, Sweet Potato Gnocchi, Shakshuka and the Grapefruit Meringue for dessert. It‚Äôs definitely pricey but so worth it. Couldn‚Äôt believe we hadn‚Äôt been here before and we have so much more to try with vegetarian food the next time we come!! Ambience is also reallyy nice, great date spot.

"Inchin's Bamboo Garden","False","True","4","Good option for indochinese food!! Ambience is really nice and food was also solid with huge quantities. Surprisingly liked the Jain Paneer Szechuan/Manchurian that a friend got more than our non Jain one which I thought would never happen to me üôàüôà So a good restaurant for Jains!","2022-06-07 16:03:19.459030+00:00"
"Sugar & Spice","False","True","4","Pretty great Thai food! Have only ever done takeout but actually really like their curries and khao suey. Nothing mind blowing flavor wise but definitely good comfort Thai food and would go back to try dine in when I don‚Äôt want to think too much about where to go.","2023-04-02 16:50:25.964768+00:00"
"Cha-Ya Vegetarian","False","True","3","Had heard a lot about this place before but thought it was pretty average. The sushi was very okay and there are definitely much better veggie sushi places in SF. The noodle soup was pretty good and comforting but nothing out of the world. It was fine as a one time try but not sure I would go back. Wish I hadn‚Äôt kept my expectations so high.","2022-06-01 21:40:14.903356+00:00"
"Cornish Pasty Co","False","True","4","Good selection of vegetarian/vegan options and have never really had anything like these pasties so points for uniqueness too. I surprisingly thought the vegan cauliflower vindaloo was better than the veggie tikka masala flavor wise, but the pastry was better of the non-vegan one loll. Nice intimate Irish bar vibe. Dessert hit the spot. Would consider coming back to try the other options.","2022-10-25 22:45:26.803182+00:00"
"Baan Thai","False","True","4","One of my favourite spots for dumplings! Thai red curry is also solid. Thought the drunken noodles were okay, but I‚Äôm not a huge fan of this dish anyway, ordered because Sohil wanted this üòÖ Place is super small and not at all fancy, but service is pretty fast which I appreciated üòä","2022-07-10 19:41:28.858252+00:00"
"Cuba Libre Restaurant & Rum Bar","False","True","4","Great food, great vibe. Best for dinners because you get free to entry into the restaurant-turned-club if you‚Äôve had dinner there that same night. Thought the spinach and manchego bunuelos were the best thing ever, the pineapple guac and malanga fritters with tamarind ketchup were also fantastic. I thought the paella could have used a bit more seasoning but Sohil loved it. Biggest reason for the star knockdown was there were limited veg options so we‚Äôve already had pretty much everything veg on the menu, and also because the drinks were a hit or miss. Glad we tried this at least once though!","2022-07-17 05:14:37.024733+00:00"
"Breads Bakery","False","True","5","Introduced by a friend who lives in NY and I now swear by this place. The only thing I‚Äôve ever had here is their famous chocolate babka, and I‚Äôll probably get it pretty much every time I visit NY. Have been to this location and another one closer to Central Park and both are amazing. A must go!!!","2022-07-05 17:08:50.059795+00:00"
"SuTao Cafe","False","True","2","I feel so bad giving this review because Sutao came so highly rated to me. I would have honestly given this a 1 but 2 is a benefit of the doubt rating that we just ordered the wrong things (although we ordered what had been recommended). The dishes had too much faux ‚Äúmeat‚Äù and wasn‚Äôt well balanced with having vegetables. The sauce tasted okay but they all tasted pretty much the same. It was honestly so bad we couldn‚Äôt finish eating and threw a bunch away. I might try one of the normal vegetarian items (not the faux meat) but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I‚Äôm not hesitant to go back here.","2022-09-21 13:57:51.222995+00:00"
"Indochine Vegan","False","True","4","Got takeout, had been wanting to try this place for forever. The eggplant tofu dish was okay but I actually thought the veg sushi was really good which surprised me.

"Papito Hayes","False","True","5","One of my favourite mexican places in the city! Have been here multiple times. Everything is great but I always get the burrito mojado because it‚Äôs not something you get at a lot of other places, especially not the way it is here. Other great dishes I‚Äôve tried include the Queso Fundido and El Vegetariano Enchiladas which were A+. The drinks and ambience are also top notch. Check it out if you haven‚Äôt!

"El Rey","False","True","5","The food, the vibe and the connected speakeasy all make this place a solid 5 for me. I‚Äôm not a huge salad person but that Nopales salad is so good I would definitely get it again. Also got the Zucchini Blossom and Corn Quesadilla as well as the Eggplant Enchiladas, both of which were excellent. Margaritas were also on point. Also The Ranstead Room (the speakeasy) is one of the most legitimate ones I‚Äôve ever been too, you‚Äôd never know it‚Äôs there if you didn‚Äôt look it up online üíØ","2022-07-09 16:12:28.585186+00:00"
"Aroma Mediterranean Cuisine","False","True","4","I really like the food here! Good number of vegetarian options, especially liked the dips and falafels were good.

"Felipe's","False","True","5","One of the best wet burritos I‚Äôve ever had period. Definitely envy the Harvard kids that get to go here more often. The place seems like it‚Äôs always busy and serves everything super quick depending on the line. My only complaints are the drinks are nothing special and the quantity is a bit too much, but that just means it works for 2 meals. Truly a gem and somewhere I would take people as a must try at least once!","2023-04-02 16:54:32.929461+00:00"
"Chama Mama","False","True","5","I honestly do not have a bar for Georgian food because this is the first place I ever tried it!

"Front Street Cafe","False","True","5","Great place for vegetarians!! Came for dinner and there were a ton of options. You could do vegan or vegetarian for a lot of the items and the portion sizes are also huge. My favorite dishes were probably the French onion soup and the buffalo cauliflower which were both super flavorful. But their pastas and banh mi sandwich were also fantastic. Ambience is also really cute and service is quick! Would come back here to try the other dishes too.","2022-09-29 02:35:13.027654+00:00"
"Arpeggio BYOB","False","True","4","This place was pretty great!! Cute ambiance both outside and in, a lot of vegetarian options and it‚Äôs byob! Sohil was gushing about the pasta cream sauce, and their dips were really good. The pizza, salads and desserts were a hit or miss but nothing bad, just not at the same level as other dishes.

"Jaiya","False","True","5","A friend of mine who lived in New York told me this was better than Thai Villa and I was skeptical since it‚Äôs quite the hole in the wall but I LOVED it. The volcanic tom yam soup is to die for, and everything else was really good too. The funniest part is that when we walked in pretty much 95% of the people here were Indian, so I think they‚Äôre catering to a particular type of taste buds üòÖ I‚Äôm from Thailand and I CRAVE this place, but I‚Äôm also still Indian so ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è","2022-07-05 15:40:15.801126+00:00"
"Sweet Maple","False","True","4","A good bottomless brunch place. Lots of options on the menu to choose from - both food and mimosa flavors üòõ Food highlights were the dessert and the kimchi fries.

"Casa Barajas","False","True","3","Went after a recommendation from my Mexican Uber driver haha, they also had a good number of veggie options.

"Drink","False","True","4","Cool speakeasy vibes. I like the uniqueness of this place not having a menu and you just have to give your flavor profile to get the drink. I thought the drinks were good but not amazing. We also couldn‚Äôt get a place to sit because of how packed it was so that kind of sucked. A cool one time experience though.","2023-04-08 13:23:25.675500+00:00"
"Lolita Cocina & Tequila Bar Fort Point","False","True","5","Hands down some of the best high-end Mexican I‚Äôve had in the states!!

"Castello Ristorante","False","True","4","Yummy, unique Italian food in a beautiful ambience - actually looks like a castle from the outside! There were a decent number of options and everything felt very fresh/made to order. It was still BYOB somehow despite their extensive wine list. I also love how they have desserts of the day and brought out mini versions of all of them to show up to help us choose which we wanted!","2022-07-22 12:29:03.527372+00:00"
"Amada","False","True","4","We had been holding off on coming here since there‚Äôs no veggie paella on the menu, but turns out they can make this for you if you just ask! The paella was pretty good, the little dollops of saffron aioli that they dropped in it was definitely the best part for me. Overall pretty flavorful, but I think I still like the paella at Barcelona better overall in taste, cooking size and the fact that the portion size is smaller. Some hit or miss vegetarian tapas - I would vouch for the bruselas catalana and the artichoke and mushroom flatbread (Spanish name on the menu is too complicated haha). The Amada‚Äôs empanada was also good but it was one empanada for $12‚Ä¶ The grilled mushrooms were very okay and so was the one other items we got. They do have good wine here, but that too is pretty expensive (up to $20 a glass). Worth a one time visit for sure, not sure about repeating due to $$$.","2022-10-04 12:23:04.038878+00:00"
"Taiyaki NYC","False","True","3","Looks very cool but taste was honestly kinda underwhelming, both of the cone and ice cream itself. I can‚Äôt say it was bad but definitely don‚Äôt feel like I need to try this again meh.","2023-04-06 12:35:13.283655+00:00"
"Terrain","False","True","4","One of the most beautiful restaurant ambiences I‚Äôve ever been too. You are literally inside a greenhouse and I love that there is so much nature around. The food was good too, although not outstanding. I got the farro bowl and Sohil got the fried cauliflower sandwich. We also got the green hummus to share with friends. There are a few other vegetarian options on the menu though so I would be down to try different dishes at this place next time - which shouldn‚Äôt be hard since the menu changes seasonally!","2022-07-25 13:14:12.642962+00:00"
"Chatayee Thai","False","True","4","The first time I came here this place was definitely a 5, best spicy Basil fried rice I had ever had in the US and the Singaporean curry was great too. This time I was disappointed because the same fried rice was way too spicy and lacked overall flavor. The green curry was good but quite creamy and didn‚Äôt feel authentic. 2nd time‚Äôs rating would have been a 3 but I‚Äôm averaging out both visits here.

"K'Far","False","True","4","This place was quite awesome. We got the cream cheese and olive boreka, the chocolate babka and Sohil got a yemenite latte. They had run out of a lot of things when we came which sucked but what we did get was good (although you can‚Äôt compare to NY Breads Bakery Chocolate Babka at all). Sohil also really liked his latte. Will be back again and will try for earlier in the morning when hopefully more of the menu items will still be available!","2022-07-11 22:39:03.917058+00:00"

"Ranstead Room","False","True","4","Love how hidden this place is, A+ speakeasy vibes. The ambience inside is also really nice although it is a bit small.

"Ambrosia","False","True","3","As good as the menu looks, most of the food didn‚Äôt live up to the hype. The mushroom tortellini was good but had a strange after taste and the Mafaldine pesto had a strong kale taste and I missed the regular basil. The mushroom risotto was really good though and was a good decision. Creme br√ªl√©e was good but nothing outstanding. Appreciate that it was BYOB but they gave a very scarce ice bucket and no stand for it. The service was also a bit rude when we had arrived early, and some of the servers didn‚Äôt know how to speak English which definitely contributed to the lower rating.

"Amma's South Indian Cuisine","False","True","4","This place tastes like home ü•∞ There is a lot to try on the menu, and they do your classic dosas and idli really well. I also really love their bisi bele bath. Not a huge fan of their kothu paratha though, have had better versions of this at other places. Probably would have given 3.5 stars overall for food but gave a 4 because this is the only place I‚Äôve seen the classic bombay sizzling brownie for dessert in the US!!

"Thai Orchid of Blue Bell","False","True","4","Thai curries and Basil fried rice were pretty good. Starters were kinda meh even though they sound very appetizing. Ambience is also really nice.

The chai was also one of the best I‚Äôve had in SF which we kept stealing sips of from a friend‚Äôs order üòã Ambience is also really nice in the patio and the best part is it‚Äôs a restaurant that cares about its employees with all of their initiatives described on the menu to help explain why they do not accept tips üíØ Oh and the French toast too my god.

There are vegetarian alternatives for pretty much everything on the menu and it‚Äôs all great barring the empanadas which I think are okay. The vibe is also really nice here with margaritas to match. Definitely my go to Mexican place to bring new people visiting Philly to! They used yo have this mushroom kimchi flavored dish which I loved and I no longer see it on the menu üò≠ Might be in a secret menu or something now I‚Äôll have to ask next time. The Quesadillas are also bomb and a close second fave for me!","2022-07-08 13:39:48.177886+00:00"
"Graffiti Bar","False","True","3","Getting to the bar through the narrow alleyway (or from the restaurant) is pretty interesting, but once you get there the place is pretty small. Although the ambience is nice I do wish there was a bit more space. The drink options are not plentiful in terms of what we wanted to order and the taste was only okay. It was a good one time experience but not sure if I would come back here.","2022-09-08 11:45:32.264755+00:00"
"Hakata Ramen","False","True","3","The food was okay overall. Best things on the menu were probably the the sushi rolls (crispy sweet potato and avocado cream cheese). The bao buns had a nice sauce but there was not enough of this (we asked for a lot of extras haha). The ramen was also unfortunately not very flavorful and we had to add a ton of spice and chili soy sauce until this finally became yummy. Keeping it as a 3 because it has potential (with a lot more seasoning lol).","2022-07-18 14:21:49.748312+00:00"
"Berber","False","True","4","We only had apps here and remember everything being really good, especially the trio dips and crispy brussel sprouts. The servers were also very friendly and attentive and the ambiance is beautiful. Only wish we‚Äôd been able to try the mains and get in for the dinner show which looks like it would be amazing. Spots just sell out fast and this was a spontaneous visit for us.","2022-05-25 00:15:26.366014+00:00"
"Earth Bread + Brewery","False","True","4","Really unique and tasty vegetarian flatbreads , appetizers with a good selection of house beers in a really cute spot! We got the pierogi bread and the seed flatbreads which were both great. Would be so down to come back again with a larger group, especially during their weekday trivia nights!","2022-07-10 18:25:04.058727+00:00"
"Mango Tree Bistro","False","True","4","Go to place when I‚Äôm craving Thai food takeout and don‚Äôt have time to go anywhere far. Have only ever done takeout, and we always do the sampler curry because you get two full sized curry options for pretty much the price one. The red curry, panang curry and green curry are all all yum but haven‚Äôt tried anything else from here yet.","2022-07-20 13:54:19.199459+00:00"
"Singh's Dhaba","False","True","4","Really solid Indian comfort food. Also the lunch specials are so reasonable and worth it. I barely had a few bites from Sohil and that‚Äôs the only reason it‚Äôs not a full 5. But would definitely be down to try again when we‚Äôre looking for Indian takeout in Cambridge.","2022-10-21 17:15:44.249434+00:00"
"Spicy Moon","False","True","3","Had really high expectations coming in so was relatively a bit disappointed. Had the Dan Dan Noodles, Wontons in Chili Oil and 1-2 other veg items. Both were good but I‚Äôve definitely had better at other places. Place was also super dark and I thought the vibe was a bit sketch with the neon lighting üôàüòÖ","2022-07-05 13:23:22.304644+00:00"
"Little Szechuan","False","True","3","Got fried rice, mapo tofu and scallion pancakes as takeout because a friend of mine said this was one of her fave places. I thought it was good but nothing special, the sichuan pepper in the mapo tofu was too much for me but I know some people like that. I also felt like the food was a bit too oily when I got it.","2022-06-02 19:07:32.610357+00:00"
"Gupshup","False","True","4","The apps here were the stars. Jackfruit tacos were super flavorful, and really liked the paneer cheese rolls too. Crispy okra was okay, kinda just had mashed avocado under it rather than the promised guacamole tbh. Paneer butter masala was also really good and cocktails were nice too. Something about the Srilankan Jackfruit curry didn‚Äôt rub me the right way though, too many mustard seeds blended in I think? Service was also unfortunately not great outside, they were really slow with requests. Maybe inside service is better though? ","2022-07-07 01:24:00.352880+00:00"
