"Pongal","False","True","5","Finally — an Indian restaurant that delivers. This place is pure veg and served authentic dishes. The salty lassi, badam milk, malai kofta — everything was fresh and made from scratch. With tons of south Indian options too, it’s a clear cut favorite. Would definitely recommend.

"Kailash Parbat","False","True","3","Food was very average and resulted in instant diarrhea lmao — all the chaat’s tasted the same. Samosa was clearly frozen and defrosted. 

If you’re craving Indian food and don’t care about the taste of the physiological effect it will have on your body then this is the spot for you. ","2022-06-20 21:50:51.910295+00:00"
"ilili Restaurant","False","True","3","There was nothing special about the food — everything was a little too acidic. Hummus was average (much better places in the city). Lamb sausages were decent but dry. Falafel was pretty good. The grape leaves were probably best thing we had all night. 

Good to try once, not worth returning to. ","2022-06-20 15:25:12.663682+00:00"
"Local 92","False","True","5","Bottomless brunch and Gyros? Hard to resist. Awesome music in the restaurant, great decor, and incredibly good food, all for under $35/person. This is a must-eat at restaurant, and it’s conveniently located in East Village a short 5 minute walk from the 6 Train.
