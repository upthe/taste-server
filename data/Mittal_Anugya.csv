"Cafe Alyce","False","True","4","Came here on a Wednesday at around 10:30 because this place had great reviews online. It's an unexpectedly great, small brunch place with good food and cute inside decor. There's no attached parking lot but we were able to find really close street parking. The owner was there and would consistently come over to check in on us and see how we are doing which was sweet, My friend got the Bulgogi Beef Breakfast Skillet and said it was really good and filling. She got a chocolate croissant on the side which she said was not bad but a little too flaky making it harder to eat. She also enjoyed the Green Dream Smoothie and said the spinach was not too strong.

I got the breakfast burrito with mushrooms although I was in between that and the shakshuka. I don't know how to feel about grits so I didn't get the shakshuka but I would probably try that when I go back. The breakfast burrito overall was pretty yummy and I have no complaints. In general, it seems that the food is flavorful and there is a decent variety. If you have a sweet tooth during brunch, then this place is not the one for you- they have great savory options though! Also this place is definitely on the pricier end, especially given it's location in NJ. Overall though,  they do have good quality food and service.","2022-05-22 17:35:06.097008+00:00"
"Source Restaurant","False","True","4","It’s a cute brunch place in Cambridge with both an outdoor and indoor seating area. We came here on a Saturday around 1 and had made a reservation in advance. We were promptly seated indoors. The drinks looked interesting but we ended up not ordering any. I got the eggs in purgatory while my friends got the Hungover pizza, neo pizza, and French toast. Everything was great and the dough felt very airy. We also got the burrata and potatoes as appetizers. We didn’t like the potatoes that much- there was a lemony taste which we weren’t huge fans of. The burrata also tasted slightly too sweet to us and probably wouldn’t go for it again. ","2022-06-20 01:53:30.543493+00:00"
"Alimama","False","True","5","Came here with a fried by chance while passing through Chinatown, but so glad we did. It's a small little place with no indoor seating, but it is cutely decorated and they have many self ordering machines. The drinks were not only some of the most beautiful I've seen, but they also tasted great. I'm not a huge tea person but I really enjoyed the royal milk tea with mini boba. I don't know why more bubble tea places don't use mini boba because it's a much more enjoyable texture. Also the royal milk tea tasted a little like taro too me? which was honestly preferable so I liked that. The taro munchkins themselves didn't taste very strongly like taro but they were warm and who doesn't like fried dough? The onyx donut was also yummy. I've had better mochi donuts but I would come back just for the drinks because they were great!","2022-05-22 17:27:40.467787+00:00"
"Gloria's Latin Cuisine","False","True","3","Came here around 8 on a Friday night. It was pretty crowded but luckily we were able to find a table for 4 inside. I was starving so really loved the chips and dips. They give a lot more dips that most restaurants which I appreciated. They give the regular tomato salsa but also black bean dip and a spicy tomatillo sauce which I highly recommend and you should ask for if you like spice. We also ordered some queso which was nice and warm, probably one of the better quesos I've eaten. We got the spinach and cheese enchiladas, chicken mole enchiladas, and vegetable fajitas. The chicken mole enchiladas were okay, I don't love the sweetness of the sauce and didn't think the inside shredded chicken stuffing had much flavor. I did love their Spanish rice though but I always love the rice. The people I went with seemed to enjoy their meals. If I come back, I would probably try a different dish and maybe not go for the enchiladas.","2022-05-22 17:33:01.977027+00:00"
"Miracle On 9th St","False","True","4","Who else is super excited for holiday season?? I love themed bars and Miracle on 9th St did not disappoint. My friend and I came here on a Monday around 5 PM without any reservations, and we were promptly seated inside at a table. There was also plenty of room at the bar but we preferred the table. The decor inside was so adorable and I loved that they were playing Christmas music the whole time- really got us in the festive mood. They also randomly turned on disco lights at some point which gave it a cool vibe. In terms of the actual drinks, they're between $16-$18 and are your moneys worth (AKA strong). I don't know if I enjoyed the taste but I got the warm drink on the menu, the Bad Santa. It was nice because it was freezing outside but I didn't particularly love the taste. The mugs, decor, and music were cute though and I would come back just for the vibe.","2022-05-22 17:32:18.306602+00:00"
"Uptop Pizzeria","False","True","2","So to be fair, I should have known better because when does airport food not cost the price of your first born child and taste bland. But I don't know why, I had high hopes for this place. Maybe because I could see the pizzas being made and put in the mini ovens in front of me and I thought there's no way this can be messed up. It's the same idea as MOD pizza or Blaze pizza but just worse.

The pizzas are decent sized and definitely too large for 1 person. It would be perfect for either sharing or saving for leftovers. It did take ~25 minutes, but the lady warned us and it was sad seeing one person man the entire counter. She was in charge of making the pizzas, baking the pizzas, pulling out the pizzas, and dealing with the customers so major props to her. I didn't even have a problem with the wait because I was the one willing to stand there. I was excited when I got my warm spinach, artichoke pizza. I hadn't eaten all day and could feel the anticipation building, and then I took my first bite. I was disappointed. The pizza just tasted a little salty and had no other flavor. The spinach and artichokes were not evenly mixed and were concentrated in the center.

Get a cold sandwich from somewhere else or wait to get out of the airport to treat yourself to some proper NYC style pizza, but don't recommend coming here. It's too expensive, bland, and just not worth it.","2022-05-22 17:30:11.953389+00:00"
"Westville","False","True","3","Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning with a large party of 13 people total. We originally had called the Chelsea location, but they said they were unable to accommodate parties that large. It was nice that when we arrived, they gave us the entire little outdoor gazebo so all of us could fit and we had our own little private area.

Food was really a hit or miss depending on what you got. I'm not huge on sweet things for brunch because I always end up craving something savory right after, but if you have a sweet tooth, the only real option for you is the French toast. My friend got the French Toast and said it was good though! I got the breakfast burrito without the chorizo and was pretty disappointed. The tortilla was so hard and tough to cut even though they gave me a different knife. The shallots were not evenly distributed inside, and were all at one end of the burrito. It was pretty bland and I doused it was hot sauce for some flavor- did love the hot sauce though! The home style potatos were also average. Saving the best for last, the southwestern brunch bowl. My friend got this and I had a few bites and absolutely loved it. She asked for the eggs to be scrambled instead of poached, but it was very flavorful and I wish I had ordered that instead.

We got some orange juice for the table which was just Tropicana. We thought maybe it had been freshly juiced because they put a sliced orange quarter on the glass, but it seems that was more just for decoration. Service was good and they were accommodating to our large group. I don't think I'll be coming back though because the food wasn't rave worthy.","2022-05-22 17:29:11.820901+00:00"
"Hudson & Co","False","True","3","Came here on a Saturday night with some friends. It was pretty crowded when we came around 7:30. Some people were very dressed up in gowns while others were in jeans and sneakers- so there's no particular dress code you have to follow. The views were absolutely beautiful, I didn't realize this place was right on the pier. We could see the WTC and NYC skyline from our booth. This place did surprisingly also have a sports bar vibe but more classy. In terms of the food itself we split 2 pizzas: the Black Truffle Pizza and the Margherita classic. I actually liked the Margherita classic more while my friend liked the Black Truffle pizza more. I thought the Black Truffle tasted slightly sweet and was thus not as satisfying. I probably would not come back again for the food just because it was definitely overpriced. The views were nice so I might come back again just to sit at the bar but I don't think the food was exceptionally good or worth the cost.","2022-05-22 17:42:00.813048+00:00"
"Jane Restaurant & Bar","False","True","4","Came here on a Sunday morning without a reservation, so my friend and I did have to wait ~25 minutes for a seat since the place was packed. However, we were pleasantly surprised we got to sit at a table instead of the bar so we appreciated that. My friend got the Salmon Benedict and really liked it while I got the spinach and goat cheese omelette with potatos. I think the omelette was a little heavy on the goat cheese and I would have preferred if there was less, but the potatoes really hit the spot as always. Overall it was a cute place and had decent food.","2022-05-22 17:28:13.714844+00:00"
"Hangawi","False","True","5","We came here last Friday and had made reservations in advance for 1 PM. They were able to take us in a little earlier. We loved the set up of taking off our shoes and sitting on the ground. They also had other seats which were built into the ground so you could sit normally but it gave the feel that you were sitting on the ground. It can be difficult to find vegetarian/vegan options at Korean restaurants normally so it was very exciting to see they had so many options. I got the spicy rice cakes which were delicious and my friend got the spicy tofu kimchi hot pot which was really flavorful. They also gave complimentary spicy kimchi which we loved. I would definitely like to go back to try some of their other dishes and drinks!","2022-05-22 17:26:07.391077+00:00"
"Kogane Ramen","False","True","3","Made a reservation for a table of 7 2 days in advance, and we were promptly seated on arrival. We went on a Sunday evening and it was a small, intimate restaurant. I liked the decorations and the service was prompt. One thing I didn't love is that they brought the food out one at a time, and there was a large gap between when the food came out so we all started eating at different times.

In terms of the food itself, my group didn't love it. I got the spicy vegetarian ramen and it tasted a little bland. The taste of soy sauce was overwhelming and the ratio of noodle to soup was less than ideal. In addition, there weren't that many toppings in the soup. I counted probably a total of 4 shitaake mushrooms and the okra was a strange combination. It also wasn't that spicy because my nose never started rubbing and my eyes didn't start watering. My friend who got the spicy miso ramen was also disappointed because she found the broth too salty. The ramen burger was also pretty unexciting, it was small and not very filling.

Overall, nothing exceptional and probably will not be going back. There are many other ramen spots in NYC which are more flavorful and hit the spot.","2022-05-22 17:29:52.673393+00:00"
"Namkeen","False","True","5","My friends have been raving about this place for a while and then I saw it on Tik Tok and I decided I had to check it out. We picked up the food so it was slightly colder by the time I got around to eating it, but if I ate there while it was hotter I'm sure the food would have been even more amazing. Nonetheless, it was one of the best chicken sandwiches I got. The chicken was so well flavored and wasn't dry. I got medium spice level which definitely had some kick to it but I was able to eat it fine. I don't know if I would have been able to handle the hot level, but maybe next time if I have ice cream handy. I've heard the fries are also delicious so that's next on my list of things from here to try. Definitely will be coming back, hopefully soon!","2022-05-22 17:38:53.679514+00:00"
"The Similans Thai Eatery","False","True","4","Came here by chance with a friend when we were in the Greenbriar Shopping Center, but so glad we did! We went in pretty early, around 11:30 AM on a Saturday so the restaurant was completely empty. My friend ordered the Thai Iced Tea and Panang Curry while I got the Drunken Noodles. When the server saw we both ordered vegetarian meals, he clarified whether I'm okay with fish sauce in the drunken noodles and I really appreciate that he brought it up himself. We both got Thai Spicy for spice level and that's probably my only regret. I thought I could handle the spice but my eyes were continuously watering and my ears were ringing. DESPITE the spicyness, the food was very flavorful and I would definitely get the drunken noodles again but at a lower spice level. The Thai Spicy in the Panang curry was bearable, maybe because the coconut and combination with rice cut the spicyness? Overall, it was a great Thai restaurant and would definitely recommend.","2022-05-22 17:31:53.680478+00:00"
"Jojo's Shave Ice","False","True","4","This place has a few select ice cream flavors and shaved ice. You can add vanilla or macadamia but ice cream to the bottom of the shaved ice, but unfortunately they had run out of both flavors when we went. I got the tropical breeze shaved ice which had guava, lilikoi (like passion fruit), and mango. The combination of these flavors was absolutely delicious- I just wish there had also been some ice cream. The one problem I faced was that the ice was so tall that it fell over as I was eating it. I didn't mind because it was too much shaved ice to begin with even though I got the smallest size, but it was a little inconvenient. Otherwise though, loved this place and would definitely go here for all my shaved ice needs!","2022-05-22 17:35:53.154284+00:00"
"Amina Pizzeria","False","True","5","a m a z i n g

What a great meal to end 2021 with. My family and I had just come from Kauai and we were craving pasta. You can get tacos and pizza everywhere, but pasta was a little harder to find. I saw this place had good reviews and I was like let's try this hole in the wall. There is no seating right now due to COVID and it is only takeout, so we sat in the car and ate our food while it was pouring buckets, but it was worth it. I do wish they had a website with a proper menu online, but we were able to look at the photos of the menu people had posted to decide what we wanted. We got the spaghetti with vegetables with Alfredo sauce, spinach and cheese ravioli, and all meat calzone. The spaghetti with vegetables was slightly under salted for my liking, but otherwise delicious. There was a good deal of vegetables: bell peppers, broccoli, mushrooms and the Alfredo sauce wasn't overly creamy. The spaghetti noodles also were cooked Al dente. I might have misread this but I thought the menu said the spinach and cheese ravioli came with Alfredo sauce and I forgot to clarify, so we were slightly disappointed when we saw the marinara sauce BUT it was still one of the best spinach raviolis we have ever had. The raviolis were not over cooked but they were soft. The entire dish had been baked as well. The all meat calzone was also a hit and my dad liked that it had an Alfredo sauce instead of the typical marinara sauce.
Overall, the portions were large and filling, and the quality of food was great. It might be a little overpriced considering it is takeout, but honestly it really fulfills any and all pasta needs. If I was on the island for longer, I would definitely go back.","2022-05-22 17:38:37.439795+00:00"
"Grotta Azzurra","False","True","2","Came here for bottomless brunch using a Pulsd deal with a large-ish party with about 12 people. While it took a bit of time for everyone in our party to arrive, the service was somewhat disappointing. I kept trying to grab someone's attention to get some water for the table, but no one attended to me for over 20 minutes despite the restaurant not being very busy at the time. With the 60 minute bottomless brunch deal (where you are given special drinks), there is a limited menu with 6 items. None of the menu items were especially appealing to me. I ended up getting the breakfast sandwich without the bacon or salmon, and it just felt like a worse version of an overpriced bagel. None of my friends were impressed with their meals and even the drinks were alright (and there was a dramatic difference in the shades of the mimosas at times, not sure if they were being very watered down).

Some people in our group chose not to do the brunch menu and ordered their own pasta entrees. I had a bite of my friends baked ziti and that tasted really good. If you want to go to a quieter brunch spot to be able to have good conversation, then this might be a good place to go but otherwise it is disappointing in terms of food and service.","2022-05-22 17:41:15.660869+00:00"
"Bova's Bakery","False","True","5","Amazing cannolis. It’s a family owned place off the Main Street in North End. It’s not necessarily as popular as Mikes, but it is absolutely worth the visit. I’m not a huge cannoli person in general, but these were so delicious. They have many different options like Nutella, chocolate chip, salted caramel, crème brûlée, etc. We were told that the most popular is the chocolate chip so we all went with that. Loved it and wish I could have gone again. 10/10 would recommend! ","2022-06-20 01:42:52.669858+00:00"
"King Dumplings","False","True","5","This place is definition hole in the wall. You're not gonna get someone serving you or the cleanest set up, but the food is amazing. You can get 8 dumplings for $5 which is a steal. I was slightly disappointed to see that they only had fried pork dumplings and all the other dumplings were boiled. However, they were still so flavorful despite being boiled. I liked adding the sriracha and white vinegar while eating the dumplings, but overall it was great. There was adequate meat filling inside the dumplings as well! Love the food and recommend going here for a quick, cheap, yummy meal. Would be interested to try some of the other dumplings!","2022-05-22 17:39:43.559900+00:00"
"Aloha Juice Bar","False","True","5","I'm usually not big on pineapple, but the dole whips were amazing. The pineapple flavor is strong but not overly sweet. You can get a wide array of toppings from chocolate chips to coconut shavings to granola. Note: you can only get toppings when you get the soft serve in a cup. I got the dole whip in a cup with granola which cost a $1 extra. I loved the crunch and texture the granola added to the soft serve. Absolutely yummy and wish I had a chance to go another time during my trip.","2022-05-22 17:37:54.360766+00:00"
"Torchy's Tacos","False","True","5","Torchy's is an absolute staple and who can visit Texas without stopping here once? I'd only been here once before a few years ago, so I remembered it was good but didn't remember how good it was. We got the queso, chicken fajita taco, and fried avocado taco. The queso definitely deserves the hype. It didn't feel too cheesy and was very flavorful. I personally had the chicken fajita taco and loved it. The chicken wasn't dry and there was a good combination of flavors, especially with the additional green salsa they gave. My mom had the fried avocado taco and said it was okay, she didn't love it though. I do wish there were more vegetarian taco options but overall I liked the tacos. Also love that they gave us the option of flour tortillas because I don't like corn tortillas. The portion sizes are also pretty filling. Overall I would come back just for the queso and am glad I made the slight detour.","2022-05-22 17:34:02.204749+00:00"
"Akeno Sushi Bar & Thai","False","True","4","Came here on a Sunday at around 1 and it wasn’t too crowded- although I’ve heard it gets pretty busy on the weekdays for dinner. We sat inside because it was humid outside, but they have a nice little outdoor seating area as well. The interior is well decorated and aesthetic. Although their menu doesn’t have too many vegetarian dishes, they are very accommodating and are able to make many dishes vegetarian. We got the drunken noodles with fried tofu, veggie lover, and some sort of tuna rolls. Everything was delicious and tasted fresh. I really liked that they asked if I wanted to add tofu to my dish because most places are stingy about giving veggies and tofu. Will definitely come back for Thai food and this will be my new go to spot when I’m visiting home. ","2022-06-14 14:31:25.026715+00:00"
"Real Fruit","False","True","3","I was just doing some errands in the mall and was craving bubble tea today, so I decided to stop by this place. I looked at some of the reviews online and saw that their milk teas are usually too sweet and taste very generic, so I opted to go with the Mango Diamond Slush and I added tapioca to it as well. I will say that the reviews were right in that the slush does taste pretty fresh. You can actually taste that it is made from real mangos and not artificially flavored. I also happened to see a worker bringing a whole cart of fresh fruits so I appreciated that. However, I don't think I would come back or it was worth the price. With the tapioca pearls, which were an extra $0.50, the total was a little over $7. Not bad but wouldn't go out of my way to come here and if the mango slush is one of their best drinks, I am not that impressed.","2022-05-22 17:34:45.910729+00:00"
"CM Chicken","False","True","4","Came here for a Yelp Elite event and I am so glad I found this place. They have an outdoor seating area which I'm sure would be lovely in the summer, but otherwise their indoor seating is kind of 1 level lower. My friend and I were seated promptly and we tried the onion rings and fried dumplings. The fried dumplings have pork, glass noodles, and vegetables inside and were delicious. The onion rings were also hot and flavorful. I was pretty disappointed, however, that they didn't have tenders. I don't love wings because I don't like bones, so that was definitely a low point for me. We ordered the spicy garlic wings and the snow onion wings. The spicy garlic were a little sweet and not too garlicky flavored so I'm not sure if maybe we got some other wings. The snow onion wings were covered with a Mayo based sauce with raw white onions. It was really messy to eat but definitely the better of the 2 and something I would get again as tenders. The chicken was also tender and not dry which is a definite plus point. The quantity of food was also more than enough for 2 people. With there being 8 wings in each serving, we were only able to eat about 2 each before being full.

Overall this place has good quality food and I would come again. I would just call beforehand to make sure they have tenders next time.","2022-05-22 17:40:56.212095+00:00"
"The Horny Ram","False","True","4","Came here with some friends for bottomless on Saturday. We had to make advanced reservations and it took a little time to get seated, but they gave us a great table on the balcony. Our hostess was very nice and great about making sure our glasses were always topped off. I was more of a mimosa person but my friends also really enjoyed the Peach Bellini. The food itself was decent, not the greatest but better than a lot of other brunch places. We had some dietary limitations (egg allergy and vegetarian) but there was something for everyone. The portion sizes were also very large. Overall a great place and would love to come back!","2022-05-22 17:25:48.465898+00:00"
"Porta","False","True","3","Came here on a Wednesday night. My friend had made a reservation for 7 and we showed up around 7:05. We were promptly seated. My friend and I thought we would share a pizza and then maybe an appetizer. However, the appetizer options were pretty disappointing and didn't appeal to either of us. We instead settled on splitting a pizza which turned out to actually be a sort of folded calzone/pizza. Our server was nice enough to let us know when we were ordering, but there was nothing on the menu and it was under the pizza section. The entree itself was okay. It took 20ish minutes to come out so it was nice and warm. It was pretty small though to be split if you have a larger appetite. There were only 4 pieces total and it felt a little like an appetizer. I won't complain when there's cheese on dough, but nothing special. The restaurant itself has a nice vibe inside and I'm sure the rooftop in the summer is a great place to get drinks!","2022-05-22 17:43:33.793848+00:00"
"MACS Macaroni and Cheese Shop","False","True","5","We were staying in the nearby Embassy Suites and saw the storefront while driving past. I had recently tried this other Mac and cheese place and loved it so I was curious and immediately looked it up and saw it had great reviews. Decided that we must definitely check it out while we are here. We got hungry and decided to do the 2 minute walk over and do take out. We got 3 Mac Daddy sized Mac and cheeses: the Popeyes, jalapeño popper without bacon, and chipotle chicken.

They have some vegetarian only options: Popeyes and veggie, but they are able to modify any of their options to not include meat. The food was absolutely delicious, 10/10 would recommend. The Popeye was honestly a little on the bland side but they had some sriracha and gave that to us in a to go container. The Popeye is a great healthier option if you don't want to feel as bad while eating cheesy, delicious goodness. I also love the little Tostinis on top that are crunchy they gave. The Mac daddy size was great because now we have plenty of leftovers for a midnight snack. Loved it and would go back if I was a local.","2022-05-22 17:30:48.012703+00:00"
"Kenji Burger","False","True","2","We had heard a lot about Kenji Burger and happened to be in the area, so we decided to stop by. We were a large party of 9 and called ahead and were accommodated within 30 minutes. The staff was very adjusting and allowed us to order ahead of time while we were waiting to be seated so we could get our meals faster.
The reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is that I just did not see the hype and nobody in our party really loved their meal. They were out of the poke bowl and other fish bowl, which was a little disappointing so we got the rainbow burrito, chicken katsu bowl, loco moco bowl, and several burgers. I actually thought the chicken katsu bowl was decent but nothing special. We had some vegetarians in our group and initially we thought there were a decent amount of veggie options, but then realized the options are all very similar. The restaurant can add a Beyond Burger patty to any of their burger styles so you can try the different flavors and sauces. However, my family in general doesn't like the Beyond Burger patty so we didn't love any of the veggie burgers. If you like the patty, then the veggie burger Kenji style was the most flavorful and would recommend that. The rainbow burrito also felt like a small portion size and nothing exceptional. Overall would probably not go again and definitely not go out of my way to wait in line. The one redeeming factor would be that the staff was nice and accommodating.","2022-05-22 17:35:24.593652+00:00"
"Charm’s","False","True","4","Came here by chance, we were actually trying to go to the Mexican restaurant next door but it was too crowded. We came here on a Friday before 8 and they still had a happy hour going on. My friend and I got a lychee mojito which tasted great! I liked their plate presentation, it was unique and different. We got the Charms kee mao, pad kee mao, and panang curry with tofu. The charms kee mao surprisingly tasted different than the pad kee mao and I liked the texture of the lo mein noodles for a change from the typical flat wide rice noodles. The panang curry had a little too strong of coconut flavor for us, so we would probably not get that again.","2022-05-22 17:27:05.471995+00:00"
"Tonii’s Fresh Rice Noodle","False","True","4","I was on my self-made Chinatown food crawl and was actually trying to go to a different place, but it had closed by the time I got there. I had been wanting to try rice noodles for a long time anyways so I quickly looked for a close by place that was open. So we forgot the sauces exist and tried the rice noodles without them first and it was really bland. We then added the soy sauce, vinegar, and peanut sauce which really added a lot of flavor. The noodles are interesting because it's like layered and stuffed but overall I really liked it. It costs $5.50 which is really cheap and a pretty filling meal.","2022-05-22 17:39:23.838292+00:00"
"Filomena Ristorante","False","True","4","Came here for a friends birthday. They wait until the whole party is there before they seat you. We were all running a little late and ended up having to wait a bit before getting seated- but they were pretty accommodating. Our server was really friendly and bubbly. He was super helpful and let us know that we should probably only order 4 pastas for 6 people. We would have probably ordered a pasta per person but their servings are really generous and conducive to family style. Their bread was yummy and warm and we loved their pesto-oil dipping sauce. 
They have a decent vegetarian options and most of their dishes can also be made vegetarian. We got the vodka rigatoni (without chicken), broccoli gnocchi, and fusili alla caponata. The table favorite was the vodka rigatoni which also had mushrooms in it. There was more than enough food for the 6 of us and overall everything was delicious. Definitely on the pricier end but it ends up being less than expected when doing family style. ","2022-06-02 20:26:27.474352+00:00"
"Bang Cookies - Jersey City","False","True","5","I've walked by this place many times and finally decided to check it out! They had a lot of different options that all sounded pretty interesting and were different from your run of the mill flavors. There wasn't even regular old chocolate chip so you can imagine they really had a unique variety of flavors. My friends and I, however, can't resist a classic snickerdoodle so we went with the SnickerChurro cookies. Surprisingly the cookies were pre-packaged (maybe for hygiene/COVID reasons). We brought them back home and warmed them up, and they were everything you would want and more. The cookies are pretty thick and the filling on the inside (dulce de ledge I think) oozed out. There was a perfect balance of cookie to filling and it was overall super satisfactory. One of my favorite cookie places I've tried and I'd love to try some of the other flavors. It's on the pricier end $5-$6 per cookie, but the cookies are really large and you definitely get your moneys worth. Overall 10/10 recommend and will be back!","2022-05-22 17:32:36.704595+00:00"
"Spicy Moon","False","True","5","Came here today with a friend for lunch without a reservation, and we were promptly seated inside. They have very reasonably priced lunch specials where you can get a small bite and either a big bite or bowl for $12.95. It's a great deal for lunch in the city, and the portions were extremely filling. We got the fried vegetable dumplings with Dan Dan noodles, and cumin fries with Mayo Tofu.

I was pleasantly surprised by the food and thought it was great. The dumplings were nice and crispy. The Mapo Tofu had a nice pepper flavor and wasn't too spicy. The Dan Dan noodles had a slightly nutty taste- maybe peanuty? But they were delicious. The cumin fries tasted exactly like how they sound. Overall would recommend- it's a good bang for your buck and the food is flavorful.","2022-05-22 17:31:35.323539+00:00"
"Stuffed Ice Cream","False","True","4","What's there not to love about ice cream and donuts?? This place had so many interesting ice cream flavors I wanted to try like orange creamsicle, fruity pebbles, etc. I was boring and chose to get one of their signature cruffs (side note what does cruff stand for?) The Cookie Road had cookies and cream, rocky road, and chocolate drizzle. It really hit the sweet spot, but was pretty hard to eat. I wanted to eat it like a sandwich but that would have been too messy. My friends also liked the signature cruffs they got! This place is definitely aesthetic and decent- I don't know if I would come back. I wasn't able to finish my cruff and it would be hard to share with a friend. I might just stick to the regular ice cream, but definitely a different concept and the place has done a good job pulling it off. Their indoor seating is completely closed off for now which was a little inconvenient. Overall though, it was a cool place to visit.","2022-05-22 17:40:01.732499+00:00"
"Ramen-San","False","True","4","Came here for lunch on a Friday with a party of 5. The interior of the restaurant is pretty spacious and nice. The servers were also very attentive and constantly checking in on us. The ramen itself was ok. Coming from NYC, I've had my fair share of different ramen spots so this place didn't necessarily wow me. I got the vegetarian ramen which was supposed to be spicy, but I found it pretty mild. I thought the noodles tasted a little gritty- they were also more on the Al dente side. My friend got the tofu in hers fried ( a whole extra $2) but it was not much different from the regular tofu. My friends didn't like the kimchi and fried chicken ramen too much, but my friend with the wonton noodle ramen really liked it. Not a bad place to bring your friend when in Chicago- but still not the best.","2022-05-22 17:42:57.576280+00:00"
"YUBU","False","True","5","100% recommend this place. I honestly came across this place by chance on TikTok and I'm so glad I did! My Korean friend in high school would actually bring a vegetarian version of these to school with no specific topping, and I always loved it. When I saw the TikTok I was so excited because this was my chance to have it again. We went at around 11:30 on a Sunday, and there were only 2 other groups there. It's a small store and there's no room inside to eat. There is an outside seating area but there are only 2 small tables so not too much room. In terms of the food, I got the spicy mushroom and it was so delicious. I was doing a little food tour so that's why I only got 1, but if this is your whole meal you would definitely need to get 4-5. Honestly this place has more of a snack vibe, but it is very delicious. I believe the price per each comes out a little above 3.50 with tax. My friends loved the different flavors they got too. If there was any place on our tour we all wanted to come back to, it was this place.","2022-05-22 17:39:07.784929+00:00"
"Spot Dessert Bar","False","True","5","I love coming here and have taken a few different friends here. The desserts are unique and the flavor combinations aren't overly sweet. Also all the desserts are of course very aesthetically pleasing. I really miss the Yuzu Eskimo and wish they would bring that back because that was my absolute favorite with the citrus cutting the sweetness of the ice cream and some tanginess from the raspberry. It does get crowded and is a little cramped inside, but honestly well worth it because this place has some of my favorite desserts!! None of my friends have ever left disappointed.","2022-05-22 17:28:47.982638+00:00"
"Buddy's JC","False","True","3","Came here on a Sunday around 12:30 and it was pretty crowded! We had a large party of 8+ so it took a while for us to get seated, but the server was constantly checking on us and offered to get us drinks while we waited. The brunch menu itself has a lot of options ranging from cereal pancakes to create your own burgers to omelettes to breakfast burritos. Some people got the chicken and waffles with Mac and cheese. Don't get confused- the Mac and cheese is in the waffle, not separate! Also if you like boneless chicken, specify when ordering that you want chicken tenders. I personally got the breakfast burrito. It was okay, a little dry maybe because I asked for it without the guacamole. My friends who got the burgers were also not overly impressed. Probably would not come back, or if I would it would only be to try a cereal pancake because those seem to be really popular.","2022-05-22 17:43:50.818739+00:00"
"V{IV}","False","True","5","I'm so glad I finally found an amazing Thai restaurant in NYC. My college town had some great Thai places, and I was disappointed that I couldn't find a place that compared in a city with so many amazing restaurants. ViV will definitely be my go to anytime I'm craving drunken noodles now. I went on a Sunday afternoon with 4 of my friends. My friends got the crab rangoons as their appetizers and absolutely swear by them. For entrees, we got chicken drunken noodles, vegetable drunken noodles, panang curry, and pad Thai. The drunken noodles 100% hit the spot and would recommend. I tried the panang curry and it was also delicious- not too sweet but still savory. I will say though that the panang curry packs a little bit of a punch. Overall I loved this place and will definitely be coming back.","2022-05-22 17:41:34.938797+00:00"
"Ramen Danbo","False","True","5","I was actually originally gonna go somewhere else, but that place was closed and I saw this place had good reviews. I'm glad I came though because it's definitely going to be one of my ramen go-tos. Firstly, nothing hits like warm ramen on a cold day, but this is such a cute, quaint restaurant in Greenwich Village. I love that they have so many flavorful vegan options. I got the Negi-goma rekka ramen medium level. I liked the addition of the sesame oil as well as the powder on the side for extra spice. They give you many customization options as well like if you prefer thin vs thick noodles or overbooked vs firm noodles. The server did bring out the meat version of the dish for my friend, but he was quick to correct it once we pointed it out and very apologetic. Overall great find and would come back again!","2022-05-22 17:42:16.641384+00:00"
"Luzzo's","False","True","4","Came here on a Saturday night at about 8:30 in a party of 4. This restaurant is highly recommended by my cousin and he has been a regular for many years, safe to say it did not disappoint. For appetizers we ordered the parmigiana de melanzane, bruschetta, and burratta with prosciutto. Since the majority of our party is vegetarian, we asked for the prosciutto to come on a separate plate and the restaurant was very accommodating. I absolutely loved the bruschetta. The tomato's seemed very fresh, the bread was crispy, and there was a nice balance of basil and garlic. Maybe because I don't eat meat I couldn't appreciate the burrata, but it was nothing special and I would probably not get it again. The parmegiana was also delicious and definitely a table favorite.

Now to the exciting part: the pizzas. We got 2 pizzas for the table: Ortolana pizza and Pizza Fritta. Unfortunately we had asked for the pizza fritta without ham and they forgot to do that so most of us did not eat it. However, I tried the outside bread part and that at least tasted like fried bread and deliciousness. The Ortolana pizza, however, was great! We got a 12 inch amongst 3 people, and it was extremely filling. The different toppings went together great and I especially loved the mushrooms! Overall, would come again for some delicious pizza.","2022-05-22 17:31:09.996224+00:00"
"Bistronomic","False","True","5","Wow what a cute little French bistro! My friend has been here before and was like we should check this place out for brunch. We were easily able to get reservations for a large-ish party the day of, and they were extremely accommodating as we added numbers to the party. I also think it was very cute that the hostess who answered the phone spoke in a French accent and gave it an authentic feel like you're visiting a cafe in Paris. The food itself was amazing. I got the savory crepe special which was chicken with cheese and a mushroom sauce on top. It was probably the best crepe I've ever had. The flavors were rich and complex and balanced each other so well. Some people got the Eggs Benedict, one of my friends got the mushroom omelette, another got the French Toast, and then one of them got the pancakes. Regardless of what people ordered, they loved it and said it was one of the best pancakes/ omelettes they had ever had. The service was also great in person and overall just a very solid place. I don't usually love French cuisine- mainly because the vegetarian options are typically lacking, but we had several vegetarians (as long as you're ok with eggs) who enjoyed their brunch meals!","2022-05-22 17:43:19.303771+00:00"
"Velvet Taco","False","True","5","Was visiting Texas this weekend, and I knew that I had to visit Velvet Taco. I already went to Torchys yesterday, and Velvet Taco was next on my list. I came here around 3 in the afternoon on a Sunday and it was pretty empty as can be expected. I thought it was really cool there was an option for drive through and would definitely use it if I was a local. I got 2 tacos: the falafel and the spicy tikka chicken. The spicy tikka chicken was very different- it didn't taste like an Indian dish but still had a unique flavor profile compared to normal chicken tacos. I also love that the standard is using flour tortillas because I'm not a huge fan of corn tortillas. The falafel one was in a lettuce wrap, which I liked because it made me feel healthier. It was a little hard to eat though, and it kind of broke apart. The falafel itself was pretty moist and flavorful, but I thought the taco was too messy to eat. Overall, they have great variety and selection of tacos and can accommodate more restrictions. Even though I didn't love the falafel taco, I really loved the spicy tikka chicken and would like to try some of the other options as well in the future!","2022-05-22 17:34:23.762050+00:00"
"Emporio","False","True","3","Came here with my aunt, uncle, and cousin on a Friday night. The interior is beautiful, but the lighting was a little too dim for our liking- it was hard to even read the menus. Overall, the food was great but the service was lacking. The restaurant was very busy and it seemed like the staff was overwhelmed. There were multiple times the wrong dish was brought to our table, and they even forgot some of our orders until we reminded them. Now on to the more exciting part- the food! Would not recommend getting the pizzas but the appetizers and pastas were delicious. Very highly recommend the Creste Di Gallo for vegetarians. The flavor of the pesto and eggplant go very well together. Another table favorite was the croquettes which were just little rice balls. Would come here again on a less busy day!","2022-05-22 17:27:25.480289+00:00"
"Scorpacciata Neapolitan Pizza Kauai","False","True","5","Oh my god- this place is amazing! I have to say Kauai has been somewhat disappointing in terms of the food scene, but this place exceeded my expectations. A few days ago I noticed a huge line outside of this place, and since then I had been interested in coming! Luckily when we came, the line was very short. I liked seeing them make the pizzas in front of us so it was piping hot when it came out. We got the Mediterranean and it was absolutely delicious!! I loved the pesto base and artichoke as well as the tartness of the sun dried tomatoes. We also got the Parmesan fries which were delicious. Highly recommend this food truck, definitely one of the best and the ingredients tasted fresh.","2022-05-22 17:36:17.896538+00:00"
"San Marzano Pasta Fresca","False","True","5","Been wanting to come here for a while because I love pasta and really wanted to try bottomless dinner. We made reservations in advance for 3 people for outside, but it decided to storm in NYC on Friday night. Luckily they were able to accommodate us indoors so we didn't get blown away by the wind and I really appreciated that. We did the prix fixe menu which consisted of 3 appetizers, an entree for each person, and unlimited sangria, wine, and beer on tap.

Let me talk about the drinks first. We only tried the red and white sangria but it was good. I usually hate red wine in general and find it too bitter, but their red sangria was really sweet and just had a hint of the classic red wine bitterness. I did like the white sangria more though but both were good. We were all drinking the same thing so our waiter brought us a whole pitcher which was nice because we refilled on our own time and didn't have to keep waiting on him. Although we didn't drink that much, the drinks were pretty deceptively strong. My friend said she got buzzed off just 5 sips.

Now on to the food. For appetizers we got the Brussels sprouts, Burrata without prosciutto, and garlic bread. Not huge on Brussels sprouts in general because its too healthy for me and I was here for the carbs, but the Burrata and garlic bread was good. I put some of the Burrata and tomatoes on top of the garlic bread and it was a great combo. The garlic bread would be even better if it was cheesy garlic bread because it was dry. For the entrees, we got 2 rigatonis with vodka sauce and one alla norma. The serving size of the pasta looked small, but we were honestly so full by the end that we weren't even able to finish the pasta which is sad because I love pasta. Loved both the different sauces we got and would definitely want to eat here again!

It was really crowded so make sure to make a reservation in advance but the waitstaff was great! Overall it's every carb lovers dream.","2022-05-22 17:29:31.058202+00:00"
"Essex","False","True","4","Came here with some friends last Sunday for a bottomless brunch. It was a great experience and loved the open layout of the place. Our server also made sure we were always topped off and even ended up giving us straight champagne at the end because they ran out of orange juice. The food was better than expected. I got the Mexican matzo Brei and was pleasantly surprised. Would definitely recommend for bottomless brunch!","2022-05-22 17:26:26.152277+00:00"
"Gupshup","False","True","3","Came here on a Sunday evening and we had already made a reservation, so we were promptly seated outdoors. I came with a group of vegetarians so we ordered all vegetarian dishes. We got the pulled jackfruit tacos, paneer cheese rolls, and amritsari chole tikki for the appetizers. The paneer cheese rolls was nothing special and would probably not get again. I personally liked the pulled jackfruit tacos because it was a unique flavor profile and twist on traditional tacos. The table favorite was definitely then amritsari chole tikki. We also tried the masala chai martini which did have a very strong chai flavoring as suggested by its name. The main course dishes we got: paneer makhani and black dal were nothing to rave about. While I appreciated the attempt to make unique dishes and present them in a different way, I was left a little disappointed by the flavors and options. I will probably not be coming back.","2022-05-22 17:28:32.786097+00:00"
"The Half Pint","False","True","3","Came here on a Saturday night at 1:30 PM with 3 friends. This place is right next to Washington Square Park and is in NYU territory. It was pretty empty when we went which was good because we were able to get pretty last minute reservations. We got the boozy brunch so it was 90 minutes of mimosas with an entree. They gave you a large pitcher (like one of those tap things) so it was able to fill about 9-10 glasses. They weren't that prompt with serving, so make sure to ask for another pitcher as soon as you're close to being done because it will take them some time. They were pretty relaxed about the 90 minute time limit though which was nice.
Now the food itself was not that great. I know most people don't go to boozy brunch with the expectation of good food, but it's really not flavored well. I got the shakshuka and thought it was pretty bland. Nothing crazy about the nachos either. Our total bill ended up being ~$53 per person so for that price you can find places with better food and service.","2022-05-22 17:40:25.472439+00:00"
