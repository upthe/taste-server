"Taco Mahal","False","True","3","It’s a creative idea, but the execution is just a little off. Feels like the flavors have been muted, and they don’t have a lot of heat. Their naan taco isn’t great: a bunch of chicken curry or palak paneer just thrown into a grocery store kind of naan that cant really hold up to picking it up and taking a bite. Kind of fell apart in my hands, and the naan didn’t have the usual charred flavor on the bottom that it’s usually known for. Lot of people might like it, but if you’ve had good Indian food, this will leave something to be desired  ","2022-05-14 15:14:04.597981+00:00"
"Recovery Sports Grill","False","True","3","Food is generic, and more expensive than it needs to be. Cheap drinks in happy hour but not worth a a dedicated trip just to eat here. ","2022-05-19 10:54:29.028028+00:00"
"Mamoun's Falafel","False","True","5","This place is the cutest hole in the wall restaurant in Albany. If you didn’t know it was there, you’d definitely walk right past it. It was started by a relative of the family that started Mamoun’s in NYC. Their falafel and eggplant gyro is to die for, just go easy on the hot sauce - it’s like napalm. Mjaddra rice and a mint tea round out an awesome meal. They’ve switched to takeout only for the time being, but hopefully they start dine in again soon because the owner takes his time to talk to every guest. ","2022-05-15 13:53:10.556231+00:00"
"Pommes Frites","False","True","5","$10 bucks for a massive portion of fries and almost 30 sauces to choose from. Perfect for taking a beat after a late night out in the village ","2022-05-14 14:59:15.547872+00:00"
"Baar Baar","False","True","5","Drinks are very creative but don’t stray so far from standard cocktails that they are a risk to try out. Would recommend anything on the cocktail menu. Food portions can feel small but they’re more filling than they look. Flavors are on point, especially the paneer ","2022-05-14 15:01:03.441337+00:00"
"Tacombi","False","True","4","Baja fish tacos, which seem to be seasonal, were just the right balance of juicy and crispy. Their al pastor is really good too, and they don’t skimp on the pineapple. The chicken tacos were a little disappointing but mostly because they lacked the heat I wanted. Cocktails can be a little expensive for the portion you get but I’d skip the drink entirely and leave room for another taco if I went back. ","2022-05-15 13:56:09.623856+00:00"
"Taste Unlimited","False","True","4","Good portion size, and the ingredients are clearly high quality. Not the most creative options but it gets the job done. ","2022-05-14 15:03:26.277121+00:00"
"Saravana Bhavan","False","True","5","I’d give 10/5 stars if I could. You’re lying NYC prices for what would cost 100 rupees in Chennai but the flavors are almost identical. Worth it in my opinion Get the podi dosai, some ven pongal, and a filter coffee and you’ll be back for more within a week, guaranteed. Can’t recommend this place enough.
