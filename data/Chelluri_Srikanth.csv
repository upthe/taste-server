"Palette 22","False","True","2","it‚Äôs an all-you-can-eat buffet, with a fusion-style menu. brunch started out great, dishes were tasty and morale was high. but our experience quickly deteriorated when we started getting mediocre and subpar dishes. the service got slower, some utensils we got were dirty, coffee tasted old, and the desserts weren‚Äôt thoroughly cooked

collectively we probably tried a little less than half the menu. the best thing (which was just decent) were the curry chicken empanadas if for some reason you end up here

wouldn‚Äôt come back to eat here but decent vibes in the surrounding area with other restaurants","2022-07-21 11:37:25.651135+00:00"
"Julian's Pizza Bar","False","True","3","we ordered delivery and the pizzas were ofc fresh. the crust was soft (as opposed to being charred and/or having structure) - it kind of reminded me of middle school cafeteria pizza. they have specialty flavors like chicken parm. pizzas were alright, but too flimsy and too heavy for me","2022-07-23 14:21:52.771268+00:00"
"Keys & Heels","False","True","3","classy cocktails and aesthetic (but small) space. it‚Äôs also in upper east so it‚Äôs prob a little out of the way","2022-03-28 21:16:52.860074+00:00"
"Thai Villa","False","True","4","excellent ambiance and good thai food. the panang curry was a little oily but was good. would highly recommend the si-sa-ket. the thai tea lava cake was unique and amazing - easily the best lava cake i‚Äôve had","2022-03-27 19:19:46.674746+00:00"

"Chicago's Pizza With A Twist (Ashburn, VA)","False","True","4","known for their indian style pizzas. i‚Äôve gotten takeout a few times and always felt like they put too much ginger but great pizzas nonetheless, would recommend","2022-03-10 05:52:12.807331+00:00"
"Mehak Indian Restaurant","False","True","4","curries are pretty solid (paneer makhani specifically), biryani is decent, naan is alright. nothing mind blowing and ambiance wasn‚Äôt very great but food and service were good so it gets a 4. handful of takeout orders while we dined in which is always a good sign","2022-08-17 15:59:25.383723+00:00"
"Oxus7","False","True","4","really friendly service here and the food is good - decent kabobs and soft bread. location is not super great, in a pretty low key part of town with not much else to do/eat. but good place for some clean greek food","2022-05-02 00:09:14.422191+00:00"
"Jaipur Royal Indian Cuisine","False","True","3","used to be my fav indian place in nova but its quality went down pretty drastically imo. been here several times for both buffet and dinner. vibe is classy but food is just ok (not bad)","2022-02-24 06:03:03.749700+00:00"
"Knead Bagels","False","True","4","get the za‚Äôatar hot sandwich with veggie chorizo and thank me later. it has some really good custom aioli. also had the roasted veggie cream cheese with a bagel and it was delicious (nothing unique but v tasty). this would be a 5 but the bagel was slightly hard","2022-11-01 15:07:57.466194+00:00"

"Chennai Express","False","True","5","i came here again and i‚Äôll stand by my claim - this is the best spot for south indian food in nova

i got the paneer masala dosa this time - it‚Äôs just the same masala flavor but with paneer instead of potatoes (see pics). comes with sambar, podi, and chutneys. also had the chicken 65 which was so fresh and the chicken biryani which was decent (more of a pulao but it‚Äôll do). service was a bit better than last, maybe it‚Äôs bc they remembered us

again, the place is pretty ratchet but we were there for less than an hour and saw several people eating at the place and picking up food to go - always a great sign","2022-06-22 01:44:24.941709+00:00"
"Cereal Box","False","True","5","this is cereal flavored ice cream. i was expecting milkbar kind vibes which uses cereal milk to make their ice cream. this place just uses vanilla and grinds your choice of cereal into it - i had cinnamon toast crunch. this grinding method won‚Äôt fully/seamlessly incorporate the cereal flavor like milkbar does but i kind of liked it that way, added a crunch - see attached pic for ref

this is realistically a 4.5 but i‚Äôll give it a 5, i was pleasantly surprised","2022-05-29 00:39:18.798243+00:00"
"The Halal Guys","False","True","3","slightly overhyped but decent late night food. it‚Äôs not bad but i agree with priya, chicken was a bit dry. everyone knows halal guys has insanely spicy red sauce, my preference is one strip red and four strips white","2022-04-18 18:18:18.060035+00:00"

"Tiki Thai","False","True","3","aside from the unnecessarily loud music, this place has clean vibes for a small group - and it‚Äôs close to rtc so bonus points for that. but the food was pretty mediocre. the panang curry fell a tad bit flat in flavor and the rice was dry. thai iced tea was ok, nothing special. looked like they had a decent drink selection but my friends weren‚Äôt huge fans","2022-05-16 03:29:16.925071+00:00"

"Courthouse Kabob","False","True","5","yet another amazing experience at my favorite kabob place. i usually get the chicken kabob but decided to try the shawarma this time - and it unsurprisingly also slapped. you definitely get a bit more meat, too. i‚Äôm prob going to be alternating between the kabob and the shawarma each time i come back

service was superb as per usual. we were the very last customers that night. we ordered for pick up and i thanked them for fulfilling our last min order and told them how we always come out of our way for them because we love their food. and they ended up offering us free drinks on our way out üôÇ","2022-05-27 02:31:01.640290+00:00"
"Pupatella Neapolitan Pizzeria","False","True","3","this is a pretty subpar wood fire oven pizza place, not sure why it's so highly rated on google. maybe we just got unlucky

the pizza crust was soggy and the flavors were pretty medicore. i can make better pizza than this (i have an ooni). the mozz bread appetizer was surprisingly pretty tasty for how bland it looked, honestly liked it more than the pizza üò¨

vibes of the place were subpar, too. it's literally next to a gas station and parking is so tight. better off going to some place in clarendon proper","2022-06-18 03:45:52.554710+00:00"

"Bombay Tandoor","False","True","3","this place used to be solid but its quality has gone down. if you decide to go here, go for the lunch buffet. decent variety of food but nothing really special or great","2022-03-24 00:51:55.369638+00:00"
"Got Dumplings","False","True","5","admittedly i have lots of nostalgia for this place (one of my go to spots at uva) but they do have the best fried dumplings i‚Äôve had. i always get chicken, tofu is a bit bland. fried rice (with sriracha) and cold peanut noodles are a must","2022-04-14 20:06:19.082861+00:00"

"Nicecream","False","True","4","decent ice cream spot, they make the ice cream fresh in stand mixers with liquid nitrogen and cream. i got the affogato with vanilla bean and it was fine, though a bit sweet. i personally still prefer pitango for the subtleness of its flavors","2022-05-27 02:39:30.804428+00:00"

"Joe's Cafe","False","True","4","came here after going to the driving range about a mile away. this is in a super wack, run down strip mall kind location but was rated really well on google so we went. when we got there, the wait was 30 mins but the people in front of us said it was worth it so we stuck around - glad we did. it‚Äôs comfort food and it was generally pretty good. pancakes, eggs, and turkey sausage were solid. hash browns were ok but the grits weren‚Äôt great. staff was friendly and food came out really quick. would come back","2022-05-08 18:21:19.994657+00:00"
"Carbone","False","True","4","it‚Äôs a bit overrated. the food was good but nothing to write home about. go here mainly for the experience, not the food","2021-07-26 23:00:00+00:00"

"Punjab Grill","False","True","5","unfortunate that the place is temporarily closed for a revamp but this is my fav indian place in nova right now. really classy vibes, tasty food (though small portions). expect to spend a bit but it‚Äôs well worth it. would recommend the butter chicken. my friends got the biryani and chole and said it was solid. cocktail selection is nice, too","2022-02-24 06:16:29.910434+00:00"

"Delhi 6","False","True","3","yet another indian restaurant in the area that used to be so good (used to be a go to, even catered from here), but went down in quality. last i went, the curries felt watered down and agree w skanda - a bit flat in flavor. maybe worth going again to see if anything‚Äôs changed but it‚Äôs a 3 right now","2022-05-10 13:15:41.155366+00:00"
"Barrel & Bushel","False","True","4","another excellent experience at a tyson‚Äôs staple. summer nights on the plaza here with good company ü§åüèΩ

i got the honey chicken sliders and they were delicious (though we played volleyball for 2 hours so i was pretty hungry). the buns were toasted and sweet. ask for the (homemade?) hot sauce on the side so it‚Äôs not too messy

everything is contactless - you just order on your phone and they bring everything out. service was both friendly and quick","2022-06-24 02:48:09.297583+00:00"
"Osteria Al Volo","False","True","4","we came here just for desserts since we saw the gelato was homemade. fair warning, it had the consistency of ice cream but i was pleasantly surprised by its flavor. it was so subtle and not too sweet, exactly what i prefer. would def recommend the lava cake. the service was v friendly and they were kind enough to give us bread. i want to come back to try the entrees at some point","2022-04-16 14:04:02.008659+00:00"
"Ch√¢teau de Chantilly","False","True","4","finally made it here. pastries were mediocre (arguably subpar bc i don‚Äôt like super sweet things). but this is a 4 simply for the vibes and the hours. plus, late night summer walks in the parking lot next door with your friends ü§åüèΩ

"Sense of Thai St","False","True","5","i was a bit too harsh in my previous review. this is a 5, specifically for the chicken pad thai and the tofu. the pad thai is flavorful - it‚Äôs a little sweet but it pairs well with the spiciness. tofu dishes are pretty solid, i‚Äôm guessing they fry the tofu since they‚Äôre crispy on the outside with some structure and squish on the inside

ambiance is great and drink selection, esp during summer, is cool (though they didn‚Äôt have their usual selection last time i went)

some of the ideas behind taste were conceived at the bar here","2022-08-16 14:11:16.874495+00:00"

"Tupelo Honey","False","True","4","i had really high expectations going in because their menu looked delicious. but i hate to say that i have to just give it a 4, still a must try though

for a place that should be known for their chicken, it was actually a bit bland. the milk gravy was also lacking flavor

but their waffles were phenomenal. and their chicken tortilla soup is probably the best i‚Äôve had - i would go back just for this. service was beyond great - i called them to see if they‚Äôd seat us if we showed up 10 mins to close and they said of course. and he recognized us when we walked in and ensured we had a solid experience since it was our first visit","2022-06-21 21:56:44.739825+00:00"
"Rupa Vira's The Signature","False","True","3","warning: they don‚Äôt serve dosas on sunday, i learned the hard way

been here a few times and agree with @shrinath, apps are bomb. but entrees are mid. i got the szechuan fried rice - it‚Äôs just the asian chili sauce you get at the grocery store (had leftovers with homemade raita and it was way better). chole bhature was decent. i‚Äôm generally a fan of pav bhaji but not here, flavors too strong and it never sits well

want to come back for the chinese noodle dosa though, that‚Äôs solid","2022-06-21 21:37:46.106462+00:00"

"Valencia Luncheria","False","True","4","valencia has delicious empanadas. i got the chicken tamarillo, black bean and cheese, and the curried cauliflower + ricotta. the curried cauliflower really stood out - it was so savory and flavorful. ask for the green and red sauces on the side - the empanadas can be thick on the edges (seems like they‚Äôre all handmade) so it was good to dip them

friends got other dishes and they were just ok

our server was nice but the food + drinks came out so slowly and the aesthetic of the place isn‚Äôt anything special. but my friend who‚Äôs local said this is one of his go-to spots","2022-07-23 14:14:25.468184+00:00"

what stands out most is the phenomenal service and classy atmosphere. the waiters spared no time refilling my water, they cleaned our table after every course, and helped pack our leftovers. i wouldn‚Äôt call this place fine dining per se but it‚Äôs pretty close - the waiters were simply very friendly and attentive. the owner also always hangs out at the door to greet everyone hello and say goodbye

ofc food was great. one dish stood out the most: the tandoori paneer app, so soft and tasty. papri chaat was also so good. for entrees, they have some unique naans - i had the chilly garlic, rosemary, and goat cheese. the naans aren‚Äôt buttery but they were still tasty, though i probably wouldn‚Äôt get the goat cheese again since it seemed a bit out of place. note that the entrees are a bit small in portion size. ended w some masala chai (bit milky but still good)

i‚Äôve been to a huge number of indian places and baazi is comparable to some of the more posh places i‚Äôve been - think punjabi grill or celebration by rupa vira in dc

the must tries: the indian summer drink (basically spiked frooti), the kasoori methi chicken tikka app (this was amazing, easily the best chicken tikka i‚Äôve had for flavor, texture, and presentation), and either the chicken or paneer sirka pyaaz. both the garlic naan and rice were fresh

service was just okay (poor service is why google rated this sub-4). they messed up one of our orders and it was a little slow. but we had a large party so it‚Äôs excusable, especially since it was a small place and most other tables were filled. even with mediocre service, this place is a 5

it‚Äôs in upper west side so it‚Äôs probably going to be a hike but it‚Äôs well worth it. i‚Äôll come back at some point to try some of the other dishes. ty @gita for the original rec","2022-07-23 14:51:04.136865+00:00"

down-ranking to a 4 bc of the mediocre service, the watered-down yum yum sauce, and the fact that the sides came out cold. also the mozz fondue was just a tin foil bowl of cheese, idk what that was about","2022-07-21 05:24:31.707911+00:00"

"Spice 6 Modern Indian","False","True","2","this is admittedly a harsh review. i thought it was a 3 when i went but found myself describing it as ‚Äúbad‚Äù to a friend later that night so here we are at a 2. spice 6 is basically a chipotle for indian food like naan pizza and naan wraps

the food was mediocre at best but the naan wrap i had was pretty subpar. unlike the pizza, they don‚Äôt cook it again after it comes out of the oven so the garlic remains too raw. flavors inside were mediocre and i couldn‚Äôt finish the wrap bc the naan was too dry (i just ate the insides). chaats were also not great - in retrospect they were lacking chutneys and raita for flavor. mango lassi was fine, but nothing to write home about. service was great though

@ani and @parth kindly insisted that i try some of their naan pizza and i‚Äôll admit it was better than the wrap but it doesn‚Äôt take it to a 3 for me given i wouldn‚Äôt come back for it

pani puri with passion fruit pani was unique and flavorful. lotus root stem chaat was really good. and the black currant dahi puri was very interesting - insides had a strong kick and the yogurt mousse was pleasantly sweet, was not expecting the contrast but it was good

mai malai hu is a must if they have it (seasonal) - the red pepper sauce almost felt like a mix of italian and indian flavors, my favorite cuisines. chicken purana is okay, but it was a bit too oily compared to the other dishes. murg makhni was great. the sabzi mandi tasted truly
homemade - it was great if you like peanut-y/sesame-kind gravy. naans were fresh. pass on the chicken hot and sour soup - the fried noodles were a bit stale and the soup flavor was just medicore imo

holi rasmalai came with three flavors - paan and rose were the best (i'd get it again just for these), black currant was just ok. the chocolate explosion cake had jalebi, chocolate syrup, and ice cream - also good but super heavy

a few downsides: slightly stale puri and fried noodles for the soup, the curries were a little oily this time around, and the price-to-quantity ratio is higher than other indian restaurants

"Levain Bakery","False","True","4","heavy (thick) but good cookies, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. prefer the chocolate chip walnut and i‚Äôm not usually one to like nuts in my cookies. you need to have these with cold milk. leftovers aren‚Äôt bad once warmed up","2022-03-10 05:41:48.168614+00:00"
"Dominique Ansel Workshop","False","True","5","the breakfast sandwich was so good, the croissant was flakey and the omelette had such a delicious cream cheese + chive filling","2022-03-26 21:49:40.829214+00:00"
"Umai Ramen & Rice Bowl","False","True","4","really glad we stumbled upon this place. i asked for chicken recommendations and the nice staff suggested either the chicken spicy miso ramen or the umai curry ramen. ended up getting the latter which is just khao soi. i was pleasantly surprised - the curry broth was packed with flavor, the meat was really tender, and they did not skimp on the crispy noodles. the flavors all meshed nicely - i‚Äôve tried khao soi at lots of other places and it‚Äôs rarely as cohesive as this dish was

chicken karaage was bomb, too. not only was it nice and crispy, the chicken itself has almost a masala flavor. the karaage was delicious when coupled with the chilli oil. i also got the iced matcha milk tea - that was decent but don‚Äôt get the bubbles, they had a weird texture

overall solid spot and would def go back. great music, too, and cozy/homey vibes. i‚Äôm told the tonkatsu was fire. this is realistically a 4.5 but i tried my friends‚Äô spicy chicken and vegan miso broths and wasn‚Äôt a fan. but i was happy with my curry which is what this place seems to be known for","2022-05-25 03:16:11.172688+00:00"
"Indigo","False","True","2","i was debating between a 1 and 2. mango lassi and samosa were good, everything else was abysmal - no flavor whatsoever, this is ‚Äúindian‚Äù food for non-indian people. outdoor evening/night vibes were okay","2022-07-24 01:34:25.655354+00:00"
"Dim Sum Garden","False","True","3","got take out, it was alright - really a 3.5. got chicken soup dumplings and fried dumplings and tried some kung pao and sweet and sour chicken. worth a stop if you like dumplings but nothing fancy","2022-10-31 14:48:06.196993+00:00"
"Adyar Ananda Bhavan","False","True","3","adyar ananda bhavan is generally reputed make some of the most authentic south indian food but alas it was not great

got the paneer chilly fried off @shrinath rec - solid texture and decent flavor but was missing spice. mini tiffin upma was good, its plain dosa was solid, but the pongal came out cold. sambar was flavorful but chutneys were a slight miss, not enough spice

chole bhatura was too oily. rava dosa took about 6 years to come out but it was actually decent if you‚Äôre ok with the oil (that‚Äôs kinda how it has to be)

super chaotic inside, too - very mid place, arguably slightly subpar","2022-08-14 13:55:10.298439+00:00"
"Pizza 360","False","True","4","they‚Äôre known for their indian speciality pizza. my friends and i get this often for game nights, always solid","2022-03-10 05:46:59.164953+00:00"
"Mama Tigre","False","True","4","this is a mexican/indian fusion. pretty unique concept and the food was solid (though i didn‚Äôt like the leftovers for some reason). would recommend nachos and soup, entree was good as well. my friends say the veggie stuff here is solid","2022-02-24 06:35:25.054813+00:00"
"Burrata Pizza","False","True","4","ani overhyped this place. this is good pizza but it‚Äôs just that, nothing crazy. i had the eggplant and added some hot honey. wouldn‚Äôt mind going back to try others","2022-04-25 04:30:41.828307+00:00"
"Celebration by Rupa Vira","False","True","5","such a solid india place, compares to posh indian restaurants in dc like rasika. presentation was great and food was solid. would recommend the unique gol gappa (never had cranberry juice in the pani) and the desserts","2022-02-24 06:25:06.326929+00:00"
"Surfside","False","True","3","overhyped burrito joint. not very flavorful, especially the rice. make sure you add some of the sauce they have out. it‚Äôs in dupont so the location isn‚Äôt bad. might come back though to try their tacos","2022-06-18 22:26:52.709377+00:00"
"Sakuramen","False","True","5","excellent taste and solid spice options (1 to 10), probably the best ramen i‚Äôve had so far. would highly recommend adding the seasoned egg. i got the 7 spice level and it was way too hot for me tbh but overall, this was surprisingly good for veggie ramen","2022-04-16 02:05:00.066097+00:00"
"Asian Spice Cafe","False","True","2","pretty oily dishes but if you‚Äôre craving chinese, it gets the job done","2022-04-14 00:18:21.652583+00:00"
"Sisters Thai","False","True","4","i think this place is only bit overhyped (and slightly gone down in quality) but it‚Äôs solid. it‚Äôs probably one of the better thai places in the area. the place is a bit small but it‚Äôs cozy","2022-04-15 20:01:31.328214+00:00"
"Pipeline Bakeshop & Creamery","False","True","3","","2022-02-10 20:15:08.728842+00:00"
"Grazie Grazie","False","True","2","this place looked so good and i was looking forward to it but it‚Äôs not the move

bread was def not fresh, it was dry and super hard - which make it so difficult to eat. had to ask them for extra sauce and i still couldn‚Äôt finish it. flavors tbh sound better than they really are

lots of other places at the wharf, this is not it","2022-08-13 17:00:31.681416+00:00"
"Poffy","False","True","4","def worth a try at mosaic, flavored batter mini pancake balls (or waffles) with toppings/sauce. we got oreo batter with chocolate sauce and it was pretty good","2022-06-21 21:42:48.420267+00:00"
"Soricha","False","True","4","came to tysons and found this new spot - i asked them and they just opened three weeks ago. i got the roasted dandelion iced latte and it was good. it was surprisingly tea-based but tasted like coffee. plus, the people were really friendly. would come back to try some of their other flavors","2022-05-01 00:54:05.949303+00:00"
"Northside Social","False","True","4","got coffee with a few friends here this morning. great location and a decent bit of outdoor seating for when the weather is nice (like today)

it was relatively busy which is always a good sign. saw some people get actual brunch here, too - might come back to try at some point","2022-06-19 23:08:54.199246+00:00"
"Mochinut","False","True","4","first time having mochi donuts, they were so chewy and good. churro and lavender flavors were my fav, wish they were warmer though. also got the hot cheetos + mozz hot dog (all veggie) which was good if you drizzle the condiments (but also a little heavy). super friendly staff, too","2022-07-24 01:42:29.203742+00:00"
"Kiin Imm Thai Vienna","False","True","3","pic looks very mid but pad thai was decent. you need to get the spice tray for both spice and flavor (i got a 4/5 and it wasn‚Äôt really that spicy)

lost a star bc there was a piece of plastic in my dish, what. this would be an automatic 1 or 2 but i was hungry and food still tasted good. service was v nice","2022-10-04 02:14:03.678925+00:00"
"Dolcezza","False","True","5","one of my favorite dessert places. will always stop by either here or mom & pop‚Äôs right next door (for coffee) if i eat out at mosaic. i always get tiramisu but this time i tried the sweet potato gelato - it tasted like pumpkin though, it was good","2022-03-10 04:16:50.914617+00:00"
