"William Jeffrey's Tavern","False","True","4","Got the Quesadilla here and they were pretty good but like $11 and advertised as an appetizer.

"Meaza Restaurant","False","True","4","Came here with a lot of friends to get them Ethiopian food for the first time and everyone seemed to love it! All the classic and main options were there and the staff was super helpful in helping us determine what to get and how much to get. This was the first time that many of my friends had tried Ethiopian food and everyone really seemed to enjoy and eat a lot. Make sure to go with a group of people to be able and try multiple things ","2022-05-14 13:53:57.682626+00:00"
"Sō Korean Barbeque","False","True","5","Food was great and service was excellent. Had the all you can eat buffet (which was $33) but the food was really good and I would definitely go back again","2022-04-19 05:03:00.072638+00:00"

"Boylan Heights","False","True","5","This might be a hot take but Boylan has always been my favorite place to get burgers. The build your own burger, milkshakes, and curly fries have always been a classic combination and the food tastes great. Every time I’m at Cville Boylan is always a spot I try to go to","2022-05-14 13:51:08.945519+00:00"
"Got Dumplings","False","True","5","BEST. DUMPLINGS. EVER.

Literally one of my favorite places at YVA. My go-to is pork dumplings, noodles, and fried rice and it hits every time. Plus they have boba tea which is always a great drink to have. If you’re in the UVA area ever, this is a must have","2022-05-14 19:39:40.765064+00:00"

"Tiki Thai","False","True","4","Drunken noodles were really bomb! Thai tea was an L though - was mostly just ice. Also, music was loud which made hearing other people difficult but the atmosphere was immaculate other than that. Great service too","2022-05-16 04:07:27.064836+00:00"
"Open Road","False","True","4","Got the BBQ Pork chops here and they were so delicious! Also, this place gives popcorn out as a free snack before your food which is super original (and I may have gone crazy with the old bay). Rating this a 4 instead of a 5 because food was a bit pricey and we got seated next to their live singer outside which made talking difficult","2022-05-22 05:48:41.192463+00:00"
