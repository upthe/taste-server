"KazuNori","False","True","5","I walked into KazuNori in Santa Monica just after lunch opening on a Monday, and immediately got seated. The restaurant was full, but I was alone so it was easy. I had the sea bream, salmon, and toro hand rolls, along with a hot green tea. Each roll was served quickly and the fish was of high quality. The seaweed was delightfully crunchy, and the flavors and textures were well balanced. I think I was done with the meal in about 20 mins, which was perfect given I was just there for a quick pre-airport snack. Given the fast pace of service, I wouldn’t recommend this if you’re looking for a leisurely lunch / dinner with a companion. If you are, like me, always looking for a no frills raw fish based snack, KazuNori should most definitely be on your list! (They have many locations across LA and NYC) ","2022-06-30 00:33:31.511600+00:00"
"Lazy Bear","False","True","5","End to end truly special experience. The food was exquisite and the attention to detail was impeccable ","2022-05-18 22:41:15.998619+00:00"
"Shukette","False","True","4","Had a lovely dinner with @steven and two friends at Shukette this evening. They were backed up, so we didn’t get our table till >15 mins past our reservation time. We ordered a LOT of plates - 4 dips, 3 breads, 3 or 4 small hot plates, 2 mains, dessert - and the food came very quickly. I particularly enjoyed the lamb sausage and the hummus. The restaurant is loud so if you’re sensitive to noise, I’d caution you. ","2022-06-22 03:42:16.050642+00:00"
"Sala Thai","False","True","5","Picked up a tofu pad Thai and really enjoyed it! Have consistently heard great things about this place from friends ","2022-06-22 04:16:28.555047+00:00"
"Osaka","False","True","5","7/5 stars for this Peruvian Japanese fusion spot in Bogota. Yet another @steven recommendation that I will be dreaming about for years to come. I particularly enjoyed the wasabi ceviche, octopus roll, white truffle scallop nigiri, and angus skirt steak served with a hot stone. The salmon carpaccio with passion fruit sauce was just a tad sweet for my taste but the fish was still high quality and delicious. I’d go back again and again to try more of the menu. Also loved the interior - beautiful mix of industrial elements and natural materials. ","2022-06-30 00:50:02.503373+00:00"
"Kobrick Coffee Co.","False","True","5","Do you, like me, crave coffee at odd hours of the night? Do you crave an extensive cocktail menu, an espresso tonic, or espresso martini at 11pm, without the noise of a real hip bar? Kobrick is the place for you! Nestled in the center of Meatpacking, it’s a good spot for getting work done by day and casually drinking tasteful cocktails by night. Open till 4am with a mix of coffee inspired cocktails, mocktails, and straight espresso in a loungey atmosphere. One of my perennial nyc go-to’s for sure. ","2022-06-23 05:09:38.059411+00:00"
"Tartine Manufactory","False","True","4","I live next door to Tartine and it’s good, but has never blown me away. The morning buns at the bakery counter are very tasty. Croissants are fine (Arsicault far better!). The coffee is bad. If you need coffee, Sightglass is around the corner. I’ve done the sit down brunch once and found it overpriced for what it is. Nothing special.","2022-06-30 01:43:54.565330+00:00"
"Daily Provisions","False","True","5","Been here 3 days in a row for egg sandwiches and coffee. Really cute spot with seating (if you can snag it, big if…) and delicious food. The egg sandwich comes with a real fried (and therefore runny) egg, so do NOT recommend eating on the go. If you don’t order ahead, prepare for a lengthy line as this is a well loved and usually busy establishment.  ","2022-06-23 05:15:23.467468+00:00"
"Wildseed","False","True","5","Tasty drinks and filling vegan menu. I forgot I was eating vegan food! Recommend the curry dish and the Mediterranean sampler appetizer ","2022-06-13 17:20:41.986986+00:00"
"Los Mariscos","False","True","5","Solid seafood (ceviche, fish taco, aguachile) place with limited fanfare in Chelsea Market. Order at the counter and eat in or outside at picnic tables. I really enjoyed the ceviche especial. The green aguachile was flavorful but not for the faint of heart from a spice tolerance perspective ","2022-06-21 00:14:17.189501+00:00"
"Messenger Coffee","False","True","5","All around super coffee shop. Great flavored lattes (I had a seasonal jasmine and sawa vanilla latte), as well as really fresh baked goods (I had the spinach and goat cheese strata with flaky croissant dough). My favorite part was the location itself - 3 floors of plentiful seating and a really pleasant roof deck with fireplace! Great place to get work done. Open decently late (7pm) for a coffee shop ","2022-05-23 15:57:13.073851+00:00"
"Burma Love","False","True","5","I can’t say enough good things about Burma Love. It’s my weekly comfort food (delivery or in person) in SF! I have tried a large portion of the menu, but my greatest hits are the Burmese milk tea, the garlic eggplant (with or without shrimp), and the minced chicken with mint leaves. Many people also love the fermented tea leaf salad and the rainbow salad. Those dishes have super interesting flavor profiles and are mood dependent for me. ","2022-05-18 22:46:12.899765+00:00"
"Rooster & Rice","False","True","4","I’ve ordered R&R delivery a couple of times. They serve simple chicken rice bowls with poached organic chicken (thigh or breast meat) and broth. The broth tastes exactly like the one my mom used to make, so it’s perfect for a sick day or just a day when you’re not looking for anything overly fancy / spiced. I tried their mango pudding once, but it wasn’t a winner. Kind of sickly sweet. ","2022-06-30 00:37:51.870142+00:00"
"Wayla","False","True","5","A friend and I walked in and got a lounge table for two in the garden.  The service was really genuine, friendly, and thoughtful. The food was excellent - I particularly enjoyed the crab fried rice and basil lemonade. Generally, Wayla requires a rez so plan ahead ","2022-06-20 18:20:39.936774+00:00"
"Taqueria El Farolito","False","True","4","This burrito is the size of a small child. Big fan. Cash only if I recall correctly ","2022-06-30 00:55:09.480466+00:00"
"Tuome","False","True","5","I just found a new favorite in NYC!!! Tuome was, start to finish, superb. Really great date spot with cute ambiance / lighting, delicious cocktails, and truly special food. My friend and I got the octopus and deviled eggs to start, snow crab (& miso butter) pasta as a main, rice as a side, and seasonal bergamot yuzu tart to finish. I guarantee I’ll be dreaming about that pasta for months. 6/5!!","2022-06-23 05:05:38.375896+00:00"
