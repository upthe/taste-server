"Huangcheng Noodle House","False","True","4","Delicious hand cut noodles! Love their popular street noodle the most, but recently tried the pork and eggplant noodle and it was bomb. Casual outdoor picnic seating makes it perfect for a group lunch or dinner!","2022-04-18 19:27:51.880527+00:00"
"Dela Curo Curry","False","True","4","Tried the pork katsu curry! Curry was flavorful and comforting and I appreciated the side of saut√©ed ginger bits that you could add into it. Pork katsu was tasty but nothing crazy.","2022-05-09 22:23:14.521458+00:00"
