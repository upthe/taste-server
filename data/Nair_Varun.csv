"Mezzo","True","True","4","Always great portions at Mezzo! The patio is really pretty and great place to sit down and have a meal. A little put on the pricy side for a college town ðŸ˜›","2022-06-22 05:10:03.776767+00:00"
"Fog Harbor Fish House","False","True","4","The Linguini and Clams was really good, great portion size and delicious. The view of the pier is to die for, but it can be a bit noisy for a fine dining place. I would recommend going there right when the sun is setting if you care about ambience as much as I do. 

Iâ€™d say the food was great but on the pricy side, it was worth the money though! ","2022-06-25 03:51:00.743383+00:00"
"Eureka!","True","True","5","Loved the food and ambience at Eureka! Really good service as well. Iâ€™d definitely recommend the Eureka Burger, if youâ€™re hungry and ready to munch. Donâ€™t forget to go during happy hours ðŸ˜›","2022-06-21 01:29:38.233535+00:00"
