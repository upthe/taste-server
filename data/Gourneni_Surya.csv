"Yummy Wok","False","True","4","cheap, good tasting food. 
okay, really itâ€™s a 3/5 for quality. your typical, hole in the wall family-owned chinese restaurant. the type of place you can go to and know exactly what youâ€™re getting. general tso chicken is one of their best items and a great bang for your buck. 
the thing that gets it to 4/5 is the people that work there. theyâ€™re wonderful, kind, and always polite.
take out is the way to go, seating is pretty limited. ","2022-06-21 01:58:32.104686+00:00"
"Bruster's Real Ice Cream","False","True","5","one of the best all round ice cream spots in the area. staff are friendly and answered all my questions and let me sample their wacky flavors. coffee chocolate chip is a solid choice and a great pick me up for a lazy sunday afternoon. the key lime pie milkshake is the perfect level of tart and sweet with pie crust surprises sprinkled throughout. our dog enjoyed the pup cup (free of charge) and the atmosphere around is filled with joy and happiness. 
would go back again for their waffle cone next time ðŸ”¥","2022-05-15 22:59:27.673982+00:00"
