"Spicy Moon Vegetarian Szechuan","False","True","4","Yum!!!! We had the mapo tofu, scallion pancakes, & shitake bun. More than enough for 2 people who are only a little hungry ü´° ","2022-08-11 15:09:23.429172+00:00"
"Anything At All","False","True","2","Cornell paid for our dinner here but otherwise I would rather swim across the east river to leave roosevelt island than eat here again. The name is accurate bc they will truly give you Anything at All. Look at this mackerel. Absolutely 0 logic to these ingredients/sides/flavor profile. The other entrees were odd as well (‚Äúcornell chicken‚Äù) but i think were fine. We looked up the prices after and laughed!!! Anyway giving 2 stars bc the mocktails were good imo","2022-08-12 13:58:49.798243+00:00"
"Fancy Radish","False","True","4","more of a 4.5 :) entirely vegan restaurant on H st! nice ambience & most of the food was reaaaally good. we got 7 dishes + 2 desserts between 3 people lol but the highlights were potatoes & noodles. eggplant and truffle dishes werent worth it tbh, kind of boring/bland. mocktails also kind of mid. everything else was so yummy and im literally so stuffed rn.

"Tsunami Sushi","False","True","3","Maybe the one time i had really good sushi in denver spoiled me .. we got way too much sushi and the best roll was the shrimp tempura roll i fear. i dont even remember what else we got","2022-07-16 01:23:55.931597+00:00"
"Ocha Thai Kitchen & Cafe","False","True","3","had the pineapple curry, which was fine. curry to rice ratio was too high. pretty run of the mill imo but nice ambiance. No pic unfortunately #UNPLUGGED","2022-07-02 19:08:05.013098+00:00"
"Shamshiry","False","True","5","cute old iranian man complimented my hair. he didnt work there or anything i just loved it. i have come here since i was 8 years old and ive decided its better than alborz. Sorry","2023-01-08 01:02:19.790328+00:00"

"Piggyback","False","True","5","we got the soba salad, wings, and s&p shrimp. as @leon would say, wings were dank. I wanted to lick the sauce off the plate. soba salad was fresh and a good balance for the richer dishes. wish there were more interesting flavors there but alas. Came out to like $35 a person with tip","2022-09-15 15:10:39.720499+00:00"
"Black Sheep Bagel Cafe - Cambridge","False","True","3","What kind of bagel place doesn‚Äôt have a simple egg and cheese bagel?? They were like we dont do an egg and cheese.

"Zorba's Cafe","False","True","4","good but tbh too expensive for what u get. the issue w greek/mediterranean food imo is its so easy to make it and do it right (except maybe meat) that if i have to pay more than like $15 to me it‚Äôs not worth it, couldve just made it at home. but cute atmosphere and embarrassed myself taking this photo in front of my colleague","2023-01-08 01:00:12.537673+00:00"

"Family Ethiopian Restaurant","False","True","4","4 stars bc Hawi in Ithaca is still better (i think). we got the meat x veggie family platter (i think) and it was enough for the 3 of us (i think). Small space but wasnt busy for a Saturday around 6. Their teas and stuff looked sooooo good. lamb isnt halal which is kind of islamophobic (JOKING).

actually i think hawi‚Äôs injera is lowkey often dry so this place was better in that respect. great value too. ok thats all","2022-09-15 15:17:12.376888+00:00"

"Brew Birds","False","True","5","love this place, @jayne and my second home ‚ù§Ô∏è Food is great especially for a casual cafe. I will say the chicken sandwich I had today would‚Äôve benefited from a mayonaisesque sauce, but alas. coffee and pastries are solid too, and they have a lot of #vegan options.

"Sofreh","False","True","5","best persian restaurant food ive had outside of iran. doogh was excellent, sour and thick. tamarind fish was perfectly crispy and tender. orange chicken stew stole the show imo, sweet but mild - i usually dont like zereshk but I was eating them up. i didnt try the mirza ghasemi / maicheh (lamb shank??) but my brother & mom assured me they were gas. apps were good too - we got kashk o bademjan (good) and this mushroom thing (utter gas). only annoyance was that the owner talked to everyone outside except us LMAO","2022-07-31 02:28:02.961179+00:00"
