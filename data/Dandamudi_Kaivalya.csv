"Mama Cucina","False","True","5","I’ve been going to this place for years and it’s hands down my favorite Italian place in Glen Allen! It’s family owned, the ambiance is nice, and the food is always fresh. My favorite dishes are the rigatoni vodka and chicken francese. I highly recommend!","2022-06-23 17:34:20.832101+00:00"
