"Tancho Japanese Restaurant","False","True","5","First Omakase and it was a blast! The attentive A+ service, fresh fish imported from Hawaii and Japan, and ambiance was fantastic. We recommend sitting at the bar as we sat at a table and were listening to what the chef was explaining to those at the bar. The restaurant is tiny so the table in the middle of the restaurant felt a little awkward. 

My favorite dishes were the unique appetizers: 1. Uni Chawanmushi- savory steamed egg custard with sea urchin and 2. Red wine tomato- red wine tomato with homemade jellotin and Japanese citrus. 

My favorite nigiri was the Iwana- Arctic Charr. 

I did not finish the green tea with cream cheese because I was actually full from the Omakase menu. We did order 2 supplemental including sweet shrimp and another limited time nigiri.","2022-09-28 03:57:29.211017+00:00"
"Sultan's Kebab","False","True","5","This place is easy to get takeout for a get together or a quick lunch. I love their chicken schwarma plate that comes with chicken, salad, rice, hummus, and pita. So many dishes to try! Will definitely be coming back often","2022-09-09 18:13:25.174636+00:00"
