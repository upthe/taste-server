"White Dog Cafe","False","True","5","The PB&J French toast was really good. Had never tried a French toast with peanut butter and was a bit apprehensive but it worked really well. ","2022-05-22 17:50:15.313744+00:00"
"Bibble & Sip","False","True","4","Got the raspberry lychee tart, an earl grey cream puff, and a latte. The tart was so cute and really delicious. The flavors all worked so well together. The cream puff ended up being too much (I got excited ðŸ˜…) and too sweet so I couldnâ€™t finish it. 

The cafe is also a cozy spot for people watching. ","2022-05-27 14:19:00.938070+00:00"
