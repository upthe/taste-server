"Zou Zou's","False","True","4","Super good medeterrian food but an incredible ambiance. Recommend all the dips and the honey pull apart bread. the branzino and fried chicken were so good too. Skip the kassari cheese but deff get the charred broccoli. Skip the drinks, they are average. This is a 4.5/5 place. ","2022-05-18 04:15:58.010394+00:00"
"Limantour","False","True","4","Supposedly the #1 bar in North America in 2021 but I wasnâ€™t blown away by it. Drinks were really solid but ambiance was very mediocre. We went to the one in Polonco so not the main location. Iâ€™d recommend going to the one in Roma Northe. The mezcal drinks were the best ones.  ","2022-04-11 15:22:39.614738+00:00"

"Chinese Tuxedo","False","True","4","This place is vibey and pretty popular. Given price point and food quality, Iâ€™d say itâ€™s at best a one time experience.

Super pricey though with the bill coming out to almost $190 per person. Itâ€™s a 9 course tasting menu. Churros is a must have. Everything else was great too minus the Mole.
