"Din Tai Fung","False","True","4","Amazing food! One of the best XLBs I’ve had in a while and their string beans are to die for! Super crunchy and full of garlic, which I love :) the drinks are quite good too! I would definitely recommend the lychee martini! Bumping off one star because the wait can be long if you don’t have a reservation ","2022-05-14 06:53:26.840996+00:00"
"Teazentea - Fremont","False","True","4","Extremely overpriced but one of the best brown sugar milk teas I’ve had in a while! Definitely get it 50% or less for the sweetness as it can be quite sweet. The creamy consistency is absolutely perfect","2022-05-14 06:55:55.147524+00:00"
