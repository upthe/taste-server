"Sala Thai","False","True","5","Sala Thai never fails to disappoint me! Hands down my favorite Thai place. I got a veggie panang curry and brown rice, and it was DELICIOUS ü§§ü§©","2022-05-05 19:38:27.850159+00:00"
"Tu Madre - West Hollywood","False","True","3","Tried a Mexican place with friends in LA. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito and it was okay, mostly because I asked them to put rice in it and they didn‚Äôt. The vegan options weren‚Äôt to my liking but my friends loved their food so definitely try it out for yourself! ","2022-07-16 05:06:35.585558+00:00"
"Taco Bell","False","True","5","Taco Bell brought back its Mexican pizza today, so you KNOW I had to go get it. It was just as I remembered it, DELICIOUS ü§§ ","2022-05-19 20:25:41.738034+00:00"
"Aroma Indian Grill & Banquet","False","True","3","I got a paneer tikka masala, and it filled my craving but it wasn‚Äôt that good. Naan was undercooked and made my stomach hurt. They gave me some sides for free though, which I appreciated! It‚Äôs good to fill a craving, but I‚Äôm sure there will definitely be better Indian food elsewhere.","2022-04-21 05:23:29.975651+00:00"
"Inchin's Bamboo Garden","False","True","4","I ate the baby corn Manchurian for appetizer and garlic chili noodles with gold coins for dinner. The corn was DELICIOUS but the noodles were way too spicy for me. Gold coins were okay, but my mouth was on fire by the time I ate those. Drank the dragon‚Äôs milk and that was delicious. ‚ò∫Ô∏è","2022-07-11 15:26:50.441657+00:00"
