"Senia","False","True","5","Awesome upscale place for dinner in Honolulu. Everything was delicious, especially the famous bone marrow dish - @Yana doesn’t even like bone marrow and it was her favorite dish too!","2022-06-22 04:52:06.096765+00:00"
"Nakka - Jardins","False","True","5","One of my favorite places in São Paulo and always one of my first stops whenever I’m back (either here or the Itaim Bibi location, there’s really no difference). They do sushi and sashimi with truffle, foie gras, or aburi (lightly blowtorched - maçaricado in Portuguese) better than almost anywhere else, and the quality of the fish is amazing too. Best are the prices - honestly quite reasonable these days in USD for the quality and insane flavor (to give an example, 2 pieces of wagyu nigiri with foie gras and black truffle will set you back 10 USD, and that’s one of their more expensive pieces).

"Ulrich","False","True","3","Fine place for brunch - nothing special from the food or service, but it’s a nice environment and their coffee is good.","2022-06-22 04:45:57.262756+00:00"
"Eventide Oyster Co.","False","True","5","Truly an incredible meal. Come early and place your name on the list, they’ll text you (we arrived at 7:30pm on a Sunday and it was a 2 hour wait for 2 people). I was skeptical but it was so worth it, food was all beyond delicious, service was great too. Bathroom also had the best smelling soap ever ","2022-06-22 04:36:10.022840+00:00"
"Jordan Pond House","False","True","2","Pretty underwhelming experience. Waited longer than the quoted time, ordered the popovers (which they are famous for) and they came out lukewarm. Service was good but definitely not worth the wait or elevated prices. ","2022-06-22 04:41:05.281718+00:00"
"Manhatta","False","True","4","5 stars for the view and ambience - hard to beat the 60th floor perch over all of Manhattan. 4 stars for food, was pretty good overall - nothing wowed us but thought it was all reasonably good. 2 stars for service - was quite slow and they made a few mistakes. Would give them another try for sure though. ","2022-06-22 04:57:23.480597+00:00"
"Kinoshita","False","True","5","One of a few Japanese restaurants in São Paulo with a Michelin star. Sit at the counter and order the omakase - you’ll get a series of warm and cold dishes, each more exciting than the last. Make sure to order some extra foie gras tuna nigiri too if it doesn’t come with the omakase - best bite ever!","2022-06-22 04:43:11.058853+00:00"
"Orfali Bros","False","True","5","Wish I could rate this place 10 stars. One of the most interesting, unique, delicious meals I’ve had in a while, and definitely my number one Dubai recommendation. Food is a cool fusion of Syrian, Turkish, Japanese, and a couple other cuisines - every dish was mind blowing, and the service could not have been more friendly and cordial. They truly make you feel like old friends in the best way. ","2022-06-22 04:49:46.891488+00:00"
"Miku","False","True","5","Love the original Miku in Vancouver so was very excited when I found out there’s also a location in Toronto. It’s a somewhat different menu actually, but equally as good. Any of the pressed oshizushi and anything aburi are bound to be good. Beef tartare was also a winner this time. Great ambience and right by the water too, so a very nice area for a pre or post dinner stroll","2022-06-22 05:00:01.180984+00:00"
"Double Knot","False","True","5","Food and ambiance are always amazing here. Great mix of raw and cooked Japanese small plates perfect for sharing with friends, and their tasting menu deal ($65 for 10 courses) is pretty economical ","2022-05-19 12:34:56.646183+00:00"
"Banzeiro SP","False","True","5","Amazing Amazonian food. Nice upscale environment in Itaim Bibi - an offshoot of the original Manaus location. Everything was amazing but the cupuaçu dessert was to die for (and I’m not even usually a dessert person)","2022-06-22 04:34:37.098281+00:00"
